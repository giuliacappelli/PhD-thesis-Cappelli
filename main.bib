	abstract     = {This thesis considers various questions about acceptability judgement tasks (AJTs). In Chapter 1, we compare the prevalent informal method of syntactic enquiry, researcher introspection, to formal judgement tasks. We randomly sample 200 sentences from Linguistic Inquiry and then compare the original author judgements to online AJT ratings. Sprouse et al., 2013, provided a similar comparison, but they limited their analysis to the comparison of sentence pairs and to extreme cases. We think a comparison at large, i.e. involving all items, is more sensible. We find only a moderate match between informal author judgements and formal online ratings and argue that the formal judgements are more reliable than the informal judgements. Further, the fact that many syntactic theories rely on questionable informal data calls the adequacy of those theories into question.},

We present a comparison of different approaches to the modelling of selectional preferences, based on various ways of generalizing over corpus frequencies. We evaluate on the VU Amsterdam Metaphor corpus, a broad corpus of metaphor. We find that using only selectional preference information is enough to outperform an all-metaphor baseline classification, but that generalization through prediction or clustering is not beneficial. A possible explanation for this lies in the nature of the evaluation data, and lack of power of selectional preference information on its own for non-novel metaphor detection. To better investigate the role of metaphor type in metaphor detection, we suggest a resource with annotation of novel metaphor should be created.},

It is also special by virtue of various syntactic and semantic features, related to the situational context of football. Two areas of verb syntax, involving transitivity, are in focus: the omissibility of certain contextually recoverable “football objects” (e.g. Iniesta passed [the ball], Messi finished [the attack]) and the occurrence of “unconventional” objects of certain verbs (e.g. Their third goal killed the match, Manchester United sold Ronaldo to Real Madrid). Thus, like other special subject areas, football creates its own semanticpragmatic framework, paving the way for constructions and collocations that deviate from those applying in general language.},

It is shown that object omission in Italian is highly sensitive to the event structure template of verbs (e.g., the low degree of aspectual specification of verbs) and the elements of meaning lexicalized in the verb, interacting, in turn, with other semantic and discoursepragmatic parameters. Whereas the constraints on Indefinite Null Instantiation appear to be similar to those at work in other languages (e.g, English and French), those applying to Definite Null Instantiation display more variability.},

It is found that stylistic, semantic, and discourse factors are the most important in the phenomenon, with syntax and morphology playing relatively minor roles. Furthermore, these zero anaphors pattern like overt pronouns and have in fact replaced overt pronouns over time. A preliminary model of register variation and its consequences for the synactic analysis of recipes are also presented.},

This paper explores the interpretation of null objects (NOs) in French from this perspective. Previous accounts have determined two major classes based on the referentiality of the NO; however, these analyses end up, paradoxically, with a semantically vague description of the difference, resorting to undefined notions of identifiability, topic/focus, or probable reference. Starting from the assumption that all NOs are syntactically represented, we tease apart the contributions of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, which turn out to be simple and straightforward. We propose a typology comprising two syntactic types of NO; further nuances are a function of the varying contributions of verbal semantics and pragmatics.},

Each requires that any word tolerating an implicit complement be treated as ambiguous between two different lexical entries and that a meaning postulate or lexical rule be given to constrain suitably the meanings of the various entries for the word. I show that the positing of such an ambiguity runs counter to the facts and propose an alternative solution which does not appeal to ambiguity, meaning postulates or lexical rules. Indeed, I show that the dilemma posed by indefinite implicit complements is posed by all implicit complements and that a general solution to the problem of implicit complements follows from an independently motivated, single treatment of five other problems, that of subcategorization, that of phrasal projections of words, that of defining a model theoretic structure for phrase structure grammars, that of complement polyvalence and that of complement polyadicity.},

	abstract     = {Which normally-transitive verbs can omit their objects in English (I ate), and why? This paper explores three factors that have been suggested to facilitate object omission: (i) how strongly a verb selects its object (Resnik 1993); (ii) a verb’s frequency (Goldberg 2005); (iii) the extent to which the verb is associated with a routine – a recognized, conventional series of actions within a community (Levin \& Rapaport Hovav 2014, Mart´ı 2010, Mart´ı 2015). To operationalize (iii), this paper leverages the assumption that a given verb may be more strongly associated with a routine in one community compared to another. Comparing across the writings of different communities, this paper offers corpus and experimental evidence that verbs omit their objects more readily in the communities in which they are more strongly associated with a routine. Object-omitting uses of verbs are analyzed semantically, following other work, as intransitive aspectual activities describing the routine actions of an agent. More broadly, the paper explores how the meaning and syntactic potential of verbs are shaped by the practices of the people who use them.},

The study unveils asymmetries between English and Rutooro (a Bantu language spoken in Uganda) in the (non-)omissibility of postverbal arguments, stemming from lexicosemantic and morphological factors as well as syntactic and discoursal factors. In light of the asymmetries arising from syntactic and discoursal factors, the study adopts a typology of indefinite implicit arguments that categorizes them into two: general indefinite implicit arguments and discourse-bound indefinite implicit arguments. Denotational nuances between synonyms as well as morphological specifications are also crucial linguistic ingredients that trigger variability in the syntactic behavior of synonymous verbs intralinguistically and cross-linguistically. In order to formalize the syntactic behavior of the verbs involved, the study employs the analytical tools provided by Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG). While Asudeh/Giorgolio (2012) use a combination of LFG and Glue Semantics in order to account for the occurrence of implicit arguments, this study proposes an alternative approach, by using only the LFG functional specifications in the lexical entries of the verbs under consideration without having recourse to an auxiliary framework. Using Bresnan (1978) as a point of departure and informed by proposals advanced by Nordlinger/Sadler (2007), the study posits a non-ambiguous bistructural analysis, with the postverbal argument instantiating the specification ± higher structure – a feature that caters for the (non-)omissibility of the postverbal argument.},

The Rational Speech Act model (RSA; Frank \& Goodman, 2012) asserts that speakers plan what to say by comparing the informativity of words in a particular context. We present the first example of an RSA model of sentence-level (who-did-what-to-whom) meanings. In these contexts, the set of possible messages must be abstracted from entities in common ground (people and objects) to possible events (Jane eats the apple, Marco peels the banana), with each word contributing unique semantic content. How do speakers accomplish the transformation from context to compositional, informative messages? In a communication game, participants described transitive events (e.g., Jane pets the dog), with only two words, in contexts where two words either were or were not enough to uniquely identify an event. Adults chose utterances matching the predictions of the RSA even when there was no possible fully “successful” utterance. Thus we show that adults’ communicative behavior can be described by a model that accommodates informativity in context, beyond the set of possible entities in common ground. This study provides the first evidence that adults’ language production is affected, at the level of argument structure, by the graded informativity of possible utterances in context, and suggests that full-blown natural speech may result from speakers who model and adapt to the listener’s needs.},

The results suggest that early-learned light verbs and heavy verbs differ in the breadth of the objects they are associated with: light verbs have weak associations with specific objects, whereas heavy verbs are strongly associated with specific objects. However, there is an indication that verbs have narrower associations to objects in speech to children.The methodological usefulness of this metric is discussed as are the implications of the patterns of distributions for children’s learning of common verbs.},

(Eds.), The Projection of Arguments: Lexical and Compositional Factors. CSLI Publications, Stanford, pp. 97–134] contend that result verbs disallow object deletion because of their lexical semantic properties. Their point is that the distinction between result verbs and manner verbs with their different event structure representation constitutes the important factor, which dictates the possibility of the variation of argument realization, of which object deletion represents one instance. Responding to their claim, Goldberg [Goldberg, A.E., 2001. Patient arguments of causative verbs can be omitted: the role of information structure in argument distribution. Language Sciences 23, 503–524] presents the evidence which mainly concerns the object deletion of causative verbs (which correspond to result verbs) in English in order to show that the distinction is not substantial. The purpose of this paper is twofold. One is to present several pieces of evidence for Goldberg’s contention based on the behavior of causative verbs with respect to object deletion. It is made evident that at least some causative verbs in fact behave even freer than Goldberg’s principle predicts. The other purpose is to examine some aspects of Goldberg’s principle and demonstrate that it has a wider applicability than originally intended, which eventually indicates that the principle comprises a part of a general set of conditions on the object deletion in English. The conclusion is that object deletion is not so much sensitive to the distinction between causative verbs and noncausative verbs as Rappaport Hovav and Levin claim it to be, and therefore object deletion fails to be a good diagnostic tool for the differentiation of the two verb classes. In other words, causativity is not a good parameter for the possibility of object deletion.},

The study isolates a context in French where the use of an object clitic is not only possible, or optimal, but mostly obligatory in the adult grammar, namely the clitic left-dislocation context. In addition, the article contrasts French with English, a language that requires a null element in a similar context, topicalization. By exploring the topicalization structures, the study separates the acquisition of object clitics from object omission phenomena. The results confirm those obtained from other experimental methods and from naturalistic observation: French children, in contrast to adults, uniformly prefer null objects across different domains; they continue to do so even in a syntactically triggered context such as clitic left-dislocation. Thus, the article provides evidence for a null object stage in child acquisition independent of the parametric settings of the target language.},

	abstract     = {Abstract             This article explores a defining property of implicit null object constructions, and how this property emerges during the L1 acquisition process. Implicit objects are non-referential and characterized by a strong semantic association between a null N in object position and the contents of the verb root. By means of an elicited production study, we examine children's sensitivity to this association in terms of the typicality of implicit direct objects and of their use in a potentially contrastive context. Participants were 73 English-speaking children (between the ages of 2;09 and 5;08) and 20 adult controls. Our results show that children make a distinction between implicit objects with typical and atypical objects\textemdash even in scenarios where a previous use introduces a potential contrast\textemdash but at rates that differ from those of adults. This suggests an incomplete knowledge of the target properties of null objects and indicates that children use a referential null N until later in development, when the selectional link between V and the null object becomes entrenched and hyponymy with the verb root becomes the sole source of recoverability. We draw implications about the co-development of verb meaning and the null object construction.           ,              R\'esum\'e             Cet article explore une propri\'et\'e cruciale des constructions avec objet nul implicite et son \'emergence lors du processus d'acquisition de la L1. Les objets implicites sont non r\'ef\'erentiels et caract\'eris\'es par une forte association s\'emantique entre un N nul dans la position d'objet et le contenu de la racine verbale. \`A l'aide d'une \'etude de production ellicit\'ee, nous nous penchons sur la sensibilit\'e qu'on les enfants \`a cette association en nous basant sur la typicalit\'e des objets directs implicites et sur leur usage dans des contextes potentiellement contrastifs. 73 enfants anglophones (\^ag\'es de 2;09 \`a 5;08) et un groupe contr\^ole de 20 adultes anglophones ont particip\'e \`a l'\'etude. Nos r\'esultats indiquent que les enfants font la diff\'erence entre les objets implicites avec objet typique et atypique\textemdash m\^eme quand le sc\'enario implique un contraste\textemdash mais \`a des taux diff\'erents de ceux des adultes. Ceci semble d\'evoiler une connaissance incompl\`ete des propri\'et\'es des objets nuls de la langue cible et semble indiquer que les enfants utilisent un objet nul N r\'ef\'erentiel dans le processus de d\'eveloppement jusqu'\`a ce que les propri\'et\'es s\'electionnelles du verbe soient suffisamment enracin\'ees pour qu'une relation hyponimique agisse comme seule source de r\'ecup\'erabilit\'e. Enfin, nous explorons les cons\'equences de cette analyse pour le d\'eveloppement parall\`ele du sens verbal et de la construction \`a objet nul.},

This paper investigates object drop in the recipe and, to a lesser extent, match broadcasting registers in English, contributing an analysis of a substantial set of naturally occuring data, hence making it possible to verify observations from previous syntactic studies of the phenomenon, which were based on a restricted array of isolated sentences. Having shown that the data support the assumption that the unrealised object is syntactically active, I propose a novel analysis of missing objects in special registers, guided by recent developments in the generative linguistic theory. Null realisation of the object is considered as an issue of externalisation and intralinguistic variation is attributed to the rules operating at the SM interface which make it possible to extend the application of copy deletion, as assumed within the copy theory of movement , Résumé Bien que les objets nuls dermis sont habituellement agrammaticaux en anglais, ils sont néanmoins couramment utilisés dans certains registres. Le but de cet article est d'analyser les objets nuls dans les recettes de cuisine, et d'une moindre mesure, dans les matchs retransmis dans les médias en anglais. Nos données sont done des données naturelles, ce qui nous permettra de vérifier dans un contexte naturel certaines observations faites dans la littérature syntaxique, qui étaient auparavant toujours des cas dans des phrases isolées. Après avoir montré que les objets nuls en question sont actifs syntaxiquement, je proposerai une nouvelle analyse selon laquelle la possibilité des objets nuls est une question d'externalisation et que la variation intralinguistique est due à des régies operant au niveau de 1'interface syntaxe-phonologie, une analyse qui rend possible l'extension de l'analyse de la suppression des copies dans la grammaire.},

They do not, however, address the question of how grammatical restrictions on null complementation might interact with broader narrative conventions, in particular those of genre. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this oversight by presenting a comprehensive overview of genre-based argument omissions and offering a construction-based analysis of genre-based omission conventions. We consider five genre-based omission types: instructional imperatives (Culy 1996, Bender 1999), labelese, diary style (Haegeman 1990), match reports (Ruppenhofer 2004) and quotative clauses. We show that these omission types share important traits; all, for example, have anaphoric rather than indefinite construals. We also show, however, that the omission types differ from each other in idiosyncratic ways. We then address several interrelated representational problems posed by the grammatical treatment of genre-based omissions. For example, the constructions that represent genre-based omission conventions must interact with the lexical entries of verbs, many of which do not generally permit omitted arguments. Accordingly, we offer constructional analyses of genre-based omissions that allow constructions to override lexical valence constraints.},

Overall, argument drop is quite rare in WhatsApp messages (4–18\,\%) and the influence of extralinguistic factors seems to be rather limited. What is attested instead are structural constraints on argument drop such as those identified by Haegeman (2013) for diary subject omissions as well as those identified by Robert-Tissot (2015) for subject drop in French text messages.},

More specifically, we examine the correlation of +/Àperfective verb forms in Greek and null objects with indefinite, non-specific interpretation. It is argued that although null objects are possible with both perfective and imperfective verbs, imperfective verbs favour object omission more than perfectives. We claim that this is due to two reasons: first, that there is a difference in the syntactic representation of overt direct objects with perfective and imperfective verbs, which is associated with the notion of economy in their respective derivations, i.e. Merge as opposed to Merge + Move; secondly, that perfective verbs show an interpretive difference at the LF interface depending on the overt versus null nature of the direct object, whereas imperfectives do not. The difference is related to the semantic notion of telicity. This prediction has been tested in an off-line sentence-completion task with two groups of native speakers of Greek, an adult and a child group. The data revealed that native speakers of Greek preferred to use overt DP objects with perfective verbs more than with imperfectives. This finding is interpreted as showing that Aspect is a functional feature with an effect on argument realization.},

Object drop differs from subject drop in RWR (Haegeman 1997, 2007, this issue); dropped subjects can be of any person and can be expletives, while dropped objects can be third person only and cannot be expletives. I propose that object drop in RWR is dependent on article drop. I analyze null articles in RWR as the presence of a phonologically null determiner with the semantics of a choice function. To analyze object drop, I adopt Tomioka (2003)’s analysis for Japanese null pronouns, in which a null determiner, combined with NP ellipsis, allows a constituent with pronominal-like semantics to go wholly unpronounced. I argue that a similar process is at work in English RWR, and argue that this analysis allows us to understand the person and expletive restrictions.},

We tested whether one of these criteria, semantic selectivity, makes psychologically real distinctions between participant information that is lexically encoded and participant information that is not. We examined how readers integrated syntactically optional WH-constituents in filler-gap sentences when the participant information conveyed by the WH-filler was specific to a restricted class of verbs (i.e., source locations) and when it was not (i.e., event locations).

It sheds light on the nature of Instrument roles and instrumentality by examining the distribution in semantic space of those verbs. We show first that verbs that semantically require instruments are typically semantically more complex than predicted by current theories of the structural complexity of verb meanings. We also show that verbs that require or allow instruments constrain the end states of situations they describe more than they constrain the agent’s initial activity. Our survey further suggests that the causal role played by the instrument is more varied than suggested by previous studies and requires the introduction of a new subtype of causal relation, which we dub helping. Finally, our survey demonstrates that verbs that semantically require an instrument cluster together more closely in semantic space and constrain the instrument’s (causal) role and properties more than verbs that merely allow the presence of an instrument.},

That is, drink has two arguments because drink specifies two participants: someone who drinks and something that gets drunk. This correspondence does not appear to hold, however, in the case of instrumental participants, e.g. John drank the soda with a straw. Verbs such as slice and write have been argued to specify an instrumental participant, even though instruments do not pattern like arguments given other criteria. In this paper, we investigated how instrumental verbs are represented, testing the hypothesis that verbs such as slice encode three participants in the same way that dative verbs such as lend encode three participants. In two experiments Englishspeakers reported their judgments about the number of participants specified by a verb, e.g. that drink specifies two participants. These judgments indicate that slice does not encode three distinct arguments. Nonetheless, some verbs were systematically more likely to elicit the judgment that the instrument is specified by the verb, a pattern that held across individual subjects. To account for these findings, we propose that instruments are not independent verbal arguments but are represented in a gradient away: an instrument may be a more or less salient part of the force exerted by an agent. These results inform our understanding of the relationship between argument structure and event representation, raising questions concerning the role of arguments in language processing and learning.},

By contrast, with encodes a constraint whereby an instrument is a direct extension of the force initiated by the agent.

Even if attempts of standardization are being developed, discordance points are still present. In this paper we consider a problematic semantic role, the Instrument role, which presents differences in definition and causes problems of attribution. Particularly, it is not clear whether to assign this role to inanimate entities occurring as subjects or not. This problem is especially relevant 1- because of its treatment in practical annotation and semantic role labeling, 2- because it affects the whole definition of semantic roles. We propose arguments to sustain that inanimate nouns denoting instruments in subject positions are not instantiations of Instrument role, but are Cause, Agent or Theme. Ambiguities in the annotation of these cases are due to confusion between semantic roles and ontological types.},

The orders and the type of the embedded verbs were the same in each experiment to provide the wh-phrase type to be the main variable to compare. The general outcome of the study showed that wh-argument was processed more quickly than wh-adjunct supporting the diversification proposed by both formal and experimental approaches in terms of argument adjunct distinction. In a particular condition, in which the subcategorization features of the embedded verb mismatched with the number of arguments, the processing of wh-adjunct was faster than wh-argument.

The highly multifaceted nature of 'eat' and 'drink' events gives rise to interesting clausal properties of these predicates, such as the atypicality of transitive constructions involving 'eat' and 'drink' in some languages. The two verbs are also sources for a large number of figurative uses across languages with meanings such as 'destroy', and 'savour', as well as participating in a great variety of idioms which can be quite opaque semantically. Grammaticalized extensions of these predicates also occur, such as the quantificational use of Hausa shaa 'drink' meaning (roughly) 'do X frequently, regularly'. Specialists discuss details of the use of these verbs in a variety of languages and language families: Australian languages, Papuan languages, Athapaskan languages, Japanese, Korean, Hausa, Amharic, Hindi-Urdu, and Marathi.},

The complex combinatory possibilities as between changes of relation and changes of placement are then illustrated by pinpointing the factors that condition the use of predicates of change of placement in utterances denoting changes of relation and placement (the notion of tendenciality). Finally, a categorization of French intransitive verbs of change of relation and placement is proposed, which is based on the way these two notions interact in their semantics.},

In the first two experiments, two different groups of participants judged sentences by the method of magnitude estimation and by the method of speeded grammaticality judgments in a single session. The two experiments involved identical sentence materials but they differed in the order in which the two procedures were applied. The results show a high correlation between the magnitude estimation data and the speeded grammaticality judgments data, both within a session and across the two sessions. The third experiment was a questionnaire study in which participants judged the same sentences as either grammatical or ungrammatical without time pressure. This experiment yielded results quite similar to those of the other two experiments. Thus gradient and binary judgments both provide valuable and reliable sources for linguistic theory when assessed in an experimentally controlled way. We present a model based on Signal Detection Theory which specifies how gradient grammaticality scores are mapped to binary grammaticality judgments. Finally, we compare our experimental results to existing corpus data in order to inquire into the relationship between grammaticality and frequency of usage.},

Despite the vast body of research that assumes a distinction between arguments and adjuncts, not only in linguistics, but also in philosophy of language, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, there are no universally agreed-upon definitions distinguishing the two. The modest aim of this thesis is to investigate English speakers intuitions with respect to verbs and their arguments. To do so, the study makes use of the Core Participants Test, disguised in four different tasks, with each task eliciting, arguably, the same kind of intuitions. The results indicate that different tasks tap into either semantic or syntactic intuitions, or sometimes both. Overall, speakers' intuitions often matched linguists' views.},

Standard models of aspectual classes focus on event decompositional or featural distinctions between predicates. However, such classifications often over- or undergenerate, and also do not necessarily capture the temporal properties upon which aspectual classifications are usually based. I show that a predictive model of aspectual classes arises from two independently motivated properties of scale arguments: (a) how specific the predicate is about the final state of the patient on the scale (Beavers 2006), and (b) the mereological complexity of the scale (Beavers 2008). The resultant classification accommodates the standard Vendler dynamic classes, plus additional classes that have proved difficult for previous approaches, and also makes predictions about how argument realization and aspectual classes are related.},

Talmy (2000) introduces an influential two-way typology, proposing that languages adopt either verb- or satellite-framed encoding of motion events. This typology is augmented by Slobin (2004b) and Zlatev \& Yangklang (2004) with a third class of equipollently-framed languages. We propose that the observed options can instead be attributed to: (i) the motion-independent morphological, lexical, and syntactic resources languages make available for encoding manner and path of motion, (ii) the role of the verb as the single clause-obligatory lexical category that can encode either manner or path, and (iii) extra-grammatical factors that yield preferences for certain options. Our approach accommodates the growing recognition that most languages straddle more than one of the previously proposed typological categories: a language may show both verb- and satellite-framed patterns, or if it allows equipollent-framing, even all three patterns. We further show that even purported verb-framed languages may not only allow but actually prefer satellite-framed patterns when appropriate contextual support is available, a situation unexpected if a two- or three-way typology is assumed. Finally, we explain the appeal of previously proposed two- and three-way typologies: they capture the encoding options predicted to be preferred once certain external factors are recognized, including complexity of expression and biases in lexical inventories.},

No verb encodes both manner and result simultaneously, a truth-conditional fact that Rappaport Hovav and Levin argue follows from how verb meanings are composed at the level of event structure. However, a key issue in verifying this claim is isolating truth-conditional diagnostics for manner and result. We develop and review a number of such diagnostics and show that there are verbs that encode both meanings together, counterexemplifying their truth-conditional complementarity. However, using evidence from scopal adverbs, we argue that when the meanings occur together, they are encoded in a single, undecomposable manner+result root at event structure. This fact validates complementarity as a fact about how many and what types of roots may occur in an event structure, though it also argues for a richer typology of roots than is typically assumed, including those encoding manner and result simultaneously.},

Listeners made judgments of prosodic appropriateness (Experiments 1, 3, and 5) and comprehensibility (Experiments 2, 4, and 6) regarding spoken dialogues in which focus requirements and accent patterns on adjuncts were manipulated. All six experiments supported the claim that adjuncts cannot project focus. Regarding the relation between focus and accenting, results from Experiments 1\textendash 4 generally indicated that new (focused) adjuncts must be accented, and given adjuncts must be deaccented. However, results from Experiments 5 and 6 indicated that the accent\textendash focus relationship that held for other types of adjuncts does not seem to apply to prenominal adjectives. We suggest that contemporary semantic analyses can explain this observation by claiming that a prenominal adjective is not an adjunct of the noun it modifies, but rather, is a function that takes the noun as its argument.},

	abstract     = {Three experiments investigated the use of verb argument structure by tracking participants' eye movements across a set of related pictures as they listened to sentences. The assumption was that listeners would naturally look at relevant pictures as they were mentioned or implied. The primary hypothesis was that a verb would implicitly introduce relevant entities (linguistic arguments) that had not yet been mentioned, and thus a picture corresponding to such an entity would draw anticipatory looks. For example, upon hearing .mother suggested., participants would look at a potential recipient of the suggestion. The only explicit task was responding to comprehension questions. Experiments 1 and 2 manipulated both the argument structure of the verb and the typicality/co-occurrence frequency of the target argument/adjunct, in order to distinguish between anticipatory looks to arguments specifically and anticipatory looks to pictures that were strongly associated with the verb, but did not have the linguistic status of argument. Experiment 3 manipulated argument status alone. In Experiments 1 and 3, there were more anticipatory looks to potential arguments than to potential adjuncts, beginning about 500 ms after the acoustic onset of the verb. Experiment 2 revealed a main effect of typicality. These findings indicate that both real world knowledge and argument structure guide visual attention within this paradigm, but that argument structure has a privileged status in focusing listener attention on relevant aspects of a visual scene. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Both attachment site (noun phrase or verb phrase) and argument status (argument or adjunct) were manipulated to test the hypothesis that arguments are processed differently than adjuncts. Contrary to this hypothesis, some previous research suggested that arguments and adjuncts are initially processed in the same manner, following a general bias to attach prepositional phrases to the verb phrase whenever possible (Clifton et al., 1991). The current study supports the hypothesis for differential processing, even during the initial stages of syntactic analysis. In an eye movement experiment, readers spent less first-pass time on argument prepositional phrases (PPs) than adjunct PPs. The results support a view in which a noun's or verb's argument structure can facilitate the analysis of its arguments.},

In particular, we show that judgements are inherently multimensional in that they incorporate a range of linguistic and extra-linguistic influences, which cannot be teased apart by only considering the final judgement itself. Judgements of the gradient and time-insensitive type therefore give rise to the same interpretation problems as those faced by introspection. Thus, while we agree with Featherston that an improvement of data replicability in theoretical linguistics is highly desirable, we disagree with his claim that gradient judgements can provide significantly more grammatically-relevant information than other types of empirical data.},

Some evidence suggests that VPCs are represented by a cline where the relationship between the VPC and its component elements ranges from highly transparent (cut up) to highly idiosyncratic (make up). Other evidence supports a multiple class representation, characterizing VPCs as belonging to discretely separated classes differing in semantic and syntactic structure. We outline a novel paradigm to investigate the representation of VPCs in which we elicit illusory conjunctions, memory errors sensitive to syntactic structure. We then use a novel application of piecewise regression to demonstrate that the resulting error pattern follows a cline rather than discrete classes. A pre-registered replication verifies these findings, and a final pre-registered study verifies that these errors reflect syntactic structure. This provides evidence for gradient rather than discrete representations across levels of representation in language processing.},

	abstract     = {Bresnan et al. (2007) show that a statistical model can predict United States (US) English speakers' syntactic choices with `give'-type verbs extremely accurately. They argue that these results are consistent with probabilistic models of grammar, which assume that grammar is quantitive, and learned from exposure to other speakers. Such a model would also predict syntactic differences across time and space which are reflected not only in the use of clear dialectal features or clear-cut changes in progress, but also in subtle factors such as the relative importance of conditioning factors, and changes over time in speakers' preferences between equally well-formed variants. This paper investigates these predictions by comparing the grammar of phrases involving `give' in New Zealand (NZ) and US English. We find that the grammar developed by Bresnan et al. for US English generalizes remarkably well to NZ English. NZ English is, however, subtly different, in that NZ English speakers appear to be more sensitive to the role of animacy. Further, we investigate changes over time in NZ English and find that the overall behavior of `give' phrases has subtly shifted. We argue that these subtle differences in space and time provide support for the gradient nature of grammar, and are consistent with usage-based, probabilistic syntactic models.},

But di\textcurrency erently from languages such as French or Spanish, for example, hardly any empirical evidence has been produced that can prove the validity of that assumption. In this study, the degree of manner of motion saliency in Italian has been investigated by contrasting it to that exhibited by a typical high-manner-salient language, namely English, which has been extensively studied from this point of view. The investigation consisted of: (a) a dictionary-based lexical survey aimed at comparing the number of Italian manner of motion verbs with that of English; (b) experimental trials with Italian and English native speakers, aimed at measuring the manner of motion salience manifest in their linguistic behaviour. The experimental work with speakers involved three tests of ``ease of lexical access'', intended to establish how quickly speakers can retrieve manner of motion verbs from memory, and one test on ``spontaneous narration'', designed to test the frequency with which manner of motion verbs are used during free speech. The results of the study provide the first empirical evidence that Italian does indeed show typical traits of lowmanner-salience.},

	abstract     = {Directional resultatives show puzzling syntactic restrictions. In Romance, broadly speaking, they do not occur at all with manner-of-motion verbs. In Dutch, directional resultatives with mannerof-motion verbs usually force postpositional order in the directional PP \textemdash{} but prepositional order is grammatical under circumstances that have so far defied a unified and insightful account. Focusing primarily on Dutch, this paper presents an analysis of directional resultative constructions and the syntactic representation of manner of motion which is centred around the following main claims: (a) directional resultative constructions with manner-of-motion verbs can in principle be built on either of two structures, one featuring the light verb GO and the other the light verb GET; (b) while both light verbs take a small-clausal complement, GET takes one that is headed by a particle; (c) the particle in GET-constructions can license a null directional P in the structure of directional PPs built on a non-inherently directional adposition, and deliver prepositional order; (d) the absence of a particle in GO-constructions forces the null directional P in directional PPs built on non-inherently directional adpositions to either incorporate into GO or have the locative P embedded in its complement to raise up to it; (e) manner-of-motion verbs have a MANNER component adjoined to GO/GET; (f) P\textendash incorporation into MANNER-modified GO/GET is inadmissible (due to a ban on multiple adjunction to the same head); (g) in GO+MANNER structures, a null directional P can hence be licensed only by having a locative P raise up to it; (h) raising of a locative P up to a directional P results in postpositional word order in Dutch, whereas the absence of raising of PLoc up to PDir delivers prepositional surface order.},

Dixon offers a new approach, starting from the premiss that a speaker codes a 'meaning' into grammatical forms in order to communicate them to a hearer, who recovers the 'meaning'. He investigates theinterrelation of grammar and meaning, and uncovers a rationale for the varying grammatical properties of different words-why, for instance, we can say I wish to go and I wish that he would go, and then I want to go but not I want that he should go.In the first part of the book there is a review of some of the main points of English syntax, followed by a discussion of English verbs in terms of 'semantic types'. About thirty of these types are examined, including verbs of Motion, of Giving, of Thinking, of Speaking, of Liking, and of Typing.In the last part of the book the author looks in detail at five grammatical topics: complement clauses, which can fill subject or object slot in a main clause; the question of transitivity and causatives; passives of all kinds; promotion of a non-subject to subject slot, as in Dictionaries sellwellR; and the relation between constructions such as They walked and They had a walk, She punched him and She gave him a punchR, and He looked and He took a look.},

Our tools further help streamline the design of such experiments and assist in the extraction and analysis of the resulting data. Surveys created using the tools described in this paper can be posted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, a popular crowdsourcing platform that mediates between `Requesters' who can post surveys online and `Workers' who complete them. This allows many linguistic surveys to be completed within hours or days and at relatively low costs.

The first part of the paper focuses on the semantics of human locomotion verbs with special attention to the sort of fine-grained manner information that each language encodes. In the second part, an empirical study on how Spanish and English monolinguals categorise human locomotion verbs into three motor pattern categories (Walk \textendash{} Run \textendash{} Jump) is reported.},

	abstract     = {Readers are sensitive to the fact that verbs may allow multiple subcategorization frames that differ in their probability of occurrence. Although a verb\~Os overall subcategorization preferences can be described probabilistically, underlying non-random factors may determine those probabilities. One potential factor is verb semantics: Many verbs show sense differences, and a verb\~Os subcategorization profile can vary by sense. Thus, although find can occur with a direct object (DO) or a sentential complement (SC), when it is used to mean \^Olocate\~O it occurs only with a DO, whereas in its \^Orealize\~O sense it is SC-biased, but can take either frame. We used corpus analyses to identify verbs that occur with both frames, and found that their subcategorization probabilities differ by sense. Off-line sentence completions demonstrated that contexts can promote a specific sense of a verb, which subsequently influenced subcategorization probability. Finally, in a self-paced reading time experiment, verbs occurred in target sentences containing either a structurally unambiguous or ambiguous SC, following a context favoring the verb\~Os DO- or SC-biased sense. Sensebiasing context influenced reading times at that, and interacted with ambiguity in the disambiguating region. Thus, readers use sense-contingent subcategorization preferences during on-line language comprehension.},

It investigated how these types of information interact during anticipatory processing and how the ability to take advantage of the different types of information is affected by aphasia.                                         Method               This study used a modified visual-world task to examine eye movements and offline photo selection. Twelve adults with aphasia (aged 54\textendash 82 years) as well as 44 young adults (aged 18\textendash 31 years) and 18 older adults (aged 50\textendash 71 years) participated.                                         Results               Neurotypical adults used verb argument status and plausibility information to guide both eye gaze (a measure of anticipatory processing) and image selection (a measure of ultimate interpretation). Argument status did not affect the behavior of people with aphasia in either measure. There was only limited evidence of interaction between these 2 factors in eye gaze data.                                         Conclusions               Both event-related plausibility and verb-based argument status contributed to anticipatory processing of upcoming event locations among younger and older neurotypical adults. However, event-related likelihood had a much larger role in the performance of people with aphasia than did verb-based knowledge regarding argument structure.},

The basic hypothesis is that natural language interpretation can be characterized as an optimization problem. This innovative view on interpretation is shown to account for the crucial role of contextual information while avoiding certain wellknown problems associated with compositionality. This will become particularly clear in the context of incomplete expressions. Our approach takes as a point of departure total freedom of interpretation in combination with the parallel application of soft constraints on possible interpretations. These constraints can be contextual, intonational or syntactic in nature. The integration of pragmatic and syntactic/semantic information in a system of ranked constraints is proposed to correctly derive the optimal interpretations in cases of nominal anaphorization, determiner quantification and elliptical comparatives.},

The free dative voice turns out to be very similar to run-of-the-mill cases of reflexivity, which must likewise be modeled as a kind of voice under the theoretical assumptions of Kratzer's (1996) severance. The free dative, just like a reflexive antecedent in German, binds a variable in the local tense domain. What is highly peculiar about the free dative voice is the tree-geometrical requirement that goes along with it. The variable that free datives bind must be at the left edge of a clause-mate coargumental possessum phrase or purpose phrase (`Knight Move Binding'). Standard implementations of binding don't include requirements of this kind. The argumentation strives to show that the requirement of Knight Move Binding really exists, and that this kind of binding is a privileged configuration in the grammaticalization of reflexive pronouns crosslinguistically.},

The principal authors, Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey Pullum, are among the world's leading scholars in this area, and they have benefited from the expertise of an international team of distinguished contributors in preparing what will be the definitive grammar for decades to come. Each chapter comprises core definitions, detailed analyses, notes explaining alternative interpretations of difficult or controversial points, and brief notes on usage and history. Numerous cross-references and an exhaustive index ensure ease of access to information. An introductory section offers guidance as to how best to use the book is provided. Rodney Huddleston was until recently Professor in the Linguistics section of the Department of English at the University of Queensland, Australia, and has been publishing important books and papers on English grammar for thirty years. Geoffrey K. Pullum is Professor of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is the author of 200 articles and books on English grammar and a variety of other topics in theoretical and applied linguistics.},

In such a situation, a partial fit between the L1 and the L2 may trigger L1 transfer, whereas availability of positive evidence may allow the learner to arrive at the L2 grammar (White, 1991b). This study tested these predictions by investigating whether Japanese speakers can recognize the directional reading of English manner-of-motion verbs ( walk, swim) with locational/directional PPs ( under, behind), such as John swam under the bridge, where under the bridge can be either the goal of John's swimming (directional) or the location of John's swimming (locational). By contrast, their Japanese counterparts allow only a locational reading, as Japanese is more restricted than English in allowing only directed motion verbs ( go) to appear with a phrase expressing a goal. Thirty-five intermediate Japanese learners of English and 23 English speakers were tested using a picture-matching task. Results show that, unlike English speakers, Japanese speakers consistently failed to recognize a directional reading. I suggest that positive evidence need not only be available but also be frequent and clear in order to be used by L2 learners to broaden their interlanguage grammar.},

"Few books really deserve the cliche 'this should be read by every researcher in the field, '" writes Steven Pinker, author of The Language Instinct, "But Ray Jackendoff's Foundations of Language does."Foundations of Language offers a radically new understanding of how language, the brain, and perception intermesh. The book renews the promise of early generative linguistics: that language can be a valuable entree into understanding the human mind and brain. The approach is remarkably interdisciplinary. Behind its innovations is Jackendoff's fundamental proposal that the creativity of language derives from multiple parallel generative systems linked by interface components. This shift in basic architecture makes possible a radical reconception of mental grammar and how it is learned. As a consequence, Jackendoff is able to reintegrate linguistics with philosophy of mind, cognitive and developmental psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics. Among the major topics treated are language processing, the relation of language to perception, the innateness of language, and the evolution of the language capacity, as well as more standard issues in linguistic theory such as the roles of syntax and the lexicon. In addition, Jackendoff offers a sophisticated theory of semantics that incorporates insights from philosophy of language, logic and formal semantics, lexical semantics of various stripes, cognitive grammar, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic approaches, and the author's own conceptual semantics. Here then is the most fundamental contribution to linguistic theory in over three decades."},

We discuss the limitations of a standard algorithm for OT learning and outline how the GLA attempts to overcome these limitations. We point out a number of serious shortcomings with the GLA: (a) A methodological problem is that the GLA has not been tested on unseen data, which is standard practice in computational language learning. (b) We provide counterexamples, that is, attested data sets that the GLA is not able to learn. (c) Essential algorithmic properties of the GLA (correctness and convergence) have not been proven formally. (d) By modeling frequency distributions in the grammar, the GLA conflates the notions of competence and performance. This leads to serious conceptual problems, as OT crucially relies on the competence/performance distinction.},

	abstract     = {Distinguishing between core and non-core dependents (i.e., arguments and adjuncts) of a verb is a longstanding, nontrivial problem. In natural language processing, argumenthood information is important in tasks such as semantic role labeling (SRL) and preposition phrase (PP) attachment disambiguation. In theoretical linguistics, many diagnostic tests for argumenthood exist but they often yield conflicting and potentially gradient results. This is especially the case for syntactically oblique items such as PPs. We propose two PP argumenthood prediction tasks branching from these two motivations: (1) binary argument/adjunct classification of PPs in VerbNet, and (2) gradient argumenthood prediction using human judgments as gold standard, and report results from prediction models that use pretrained word embeddings and other linguistically informed features. Our best results on each task are (1) acc. = 0.955, F1 = 0.954 (ELMo+BiLSTM) and (2) Pearson's r = 0.624 (word2vec+MLP). Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of argumenthood prediction in improving sentence representations via performance gains on SRL when a sentence encoder is pretrained with our tasks.},

Traditionally defined as the capacity of a verb to pass the action from the subject to the object, transitivity is recognised as a descriptive feature of genres by modern-language studies. This study is based on a syntactically annotated corpus of Early Medieval documentary Latin (LLCT). Transitivity is first approached in terms of a classificatory analysis of the most common verbs of the corpus, which is then followed by a functionally-inspired transitivity component analysis of a sample (N = 810). The Latin documentary genre appears to have a bipolar transitivity profile symptomatic of its dual communicative function: the performative verbs typical of the dispositive legal language are high in transitivity, whereas the frequent relational verbs which connect concepts and properties are low. The method is expected to be extendible to other Latin genres, such as narrative and oratory.},

Linguists have tended to use constructed examples to test speakers' judgements on specific sorts of constraint violation. We applied machine translation to randomly selected subsets of the British National Corpus (BNC) to generate a large test set which contains well-formed English source sentences, and sentences that exhibit a wide variety of grammatical infelicities. We tested a large number of speakers through (filtered) crowd sourcing, with three distinct modes of classification, one binary and two ordered scales. We found a high degree of correlation in mean judgements for sentences across the three classification tasks. We also did two visual image classification tasks to obtain benchmarks for binary and gradient judgement patterns, respectively. Finally, we did a second crowd source experiment on 100 randomly selected linguistic textbook example sentences. The sentence judgement distributions for individual speakers strongly resemble the gradience benchmark pattern. This evidence suggests that speakers represent grammatical well-formedness as a gradient property.},

Acceptability judgments present a serious problem for both classical binary and probabilistic theories of grammaticality. These judgements are gradient in nature, and so cannot be directly accommodated in a binary formal grammar. However, it is also not possible to simply reduce acceptability to probability. The acceptability of a sentence is not the same as the likelihood of its occurrence, which is, in part, determined by factors like sentence length and lexical frequency. In this paper, we present the results of a set of large-scale experiments using crowd-sourced acceptability judgments that demonstrate gradience to be a pervasive feature in acceptability judgments. We then show how one can predict acceptability judgments on the basis of probability by augmenting probabilistic language models with an acceptability measure. This is a function that normalizes probability values to eliminate the confounding factors of length and lexical frequency. We describe a sequence of modeling experiments with unsupervised language models drawn from state-of-the-art machine learning methods in natural language processing. Several of these models achieve very encouraging levels of accuracy in the acceptability prediction task, as measured by the correlation between the acceptability measure scores and mean human acceptability values. We consider the relevance of these results to the debate on the nature of grammatical competence, and we argue that they support the view that linguistic knowledge can be intrinsically probabilistic.},

Cross-linguistic diachronic comparison (using data from the history of the Greek language) reveals that the historical development described is language-specific and that both directions of change (loss or rise) of null and cognate objects are possible. We will test the hypothesis that there is a connection between the availability of such (de)transitivization processes and changes that affect the syntactic representation of aspectual distinctions. More precisely, we will examine the hypothesis that in English, both the loss of definite null objects and the rise of cognate objects with activity/event nouns are linked to the grammaticalization of the viewpoint (progressive) aspect (be + V + ing). We will show that the grammaticalization of the viewpoint aspect in English has not affected the development and loss of null object constructions. However, the grammaticalization of the viewpoint aspect appears to have progressed in parallel with activity/event-noun cognate objects.},

Verb argument structure has been suggested to play an important role during grammatical encoding (Bock \& Levelt, 1994) and in speech deficits of agrammatic aphasic speakers (Thompson, 2003). However, little is known about how adjuncts are processed during sentence production. The present experiments measured eye movements while speakers were producing sentences with a goal argument (e.g., the mother is applying lotion to the baby) and a beneficiary adjunct phrase (e.g., the mother is choosing lotion for the baby) using a set of computer-displayed written words. Results showed that the sentence production system experiences greater processing cost for producing adjuncts than verb arguments and this distinction is preserved even after brain-damage. In Experiment 1, healthy young speakers showed greater gaze durations and gaze shifts for adjuncts as compared to arguments. The same patterns were found in agrammatic and older speakers in Experiment 2. Interestingly, the three groups of speakers showed different time courses for encoding adjuncts: young speakers showed greater processing cost for adjuncts during speech, consistent with incremental production (Kempen \& Hoenkamp, 1987). Older speakers showed this difference both before speech onset and during speech, while aphasic speakers appeared to preplan adjuncts before speech onset. These findings suggest that the degree of incrementality may be affected by speakers' linguistic capacity.},

Moreover, the deprofiling of the object in the case of a nuclear verb like see triggers the emergence of new pragmatic meanings, which cannot be derived from the lexical meanings of the various elements in a proposition taken in isolation, but which are interactionally-driven and surface in unpredictable ways, determining a progressive shift towards the cognitive dimension of the verb.},

While there is plentiful evidence that natural language meaning constitution exploits both mechanisms, it is an open issue whether a concrete phenomenon of meaning variability is an instance of underspecification or coercion. This paper argues that this theoretical dispute can be settled experimentally. The test case are standard motion verbs (e.g. walk, ride) in combination with {$\pm$}telic directional phrases, for which both underspecifaction and coercion analyses have been proposed in the literature. A self-paced reading study which incorporates motion verbs, directional phrases and durative/completive temporal adverbials (1) aims at determining the aspectual value of such verbs, and (2) compares the hypotheses of the Underspecification and Coercion Accounts. The results of the reading time experiment (flanked by a corpus study and a completion study) indicate that motion verbs are aspectually underspecified. They combine with {$\pm$}telic directional phrases with equal ease. The combination with a mismatching temporal adverbial is an instance of coercion, causing additional processing costs.},

This article will address the study of verbal argument structure. Research in generative linguistics without question has productively explored verbal argument structure within a general structuralist framework familiar from anthropology and the humanities, uncovering patterns and correlations across languages in the syntactic distribution and behavior of verbal arguments identified by their semantic roles, and providing structured explanations that capture these patterns in a compact and intuitively explanatory way. But this article will ask whether progress has been made in a different sense -- toward a scientific understanding of language. In other words, has the generative enterprise made good on its promise to break from the structuralist anthropological tradition (Sapir, 1921; Bloomfield, 1933) and provide an account of argument structure within a general account of knowledge of language. If such progress has been made, we could argue that researchers in human psychology and neuroscience must take note of the latest theory of argument structure to inform their experiments, not just any account that traffics in thematic roles, word order, and case marking.},

We conclude that there is enough agreement between the two notions (0.85) to make practical the simple expedient of equating core PP dependents in FrameNet with PP complements in our lexicon.

In speech and writing, ellipsis is pervasive, contributing in various ways to the economy, speed, and style of communication. Resolving ellipsis is a particularly challenging issue in natural language processing, since not only must meaning be gleaned from missing elements but the fact that something meaningful is missing must be detected in the first place.Marjorie McShane presents a comprehensive theory of ellipsis that supports the formal, cross-linguistic description of elliptical phenomena taking into account the various factors that affect the use of ellipsis. A methodology is suggested for creating a parameter space describing and treating ellipsis in any language. Such "ellipsis profiles" of languages will serve a wide range of practical applications, including but not limited to natural language processing. In contrast to earlier work, this theory focuses not only on what can, in principle, be elided but in what circumstances a given category actually would or would not be elided--that is, what renders ellipsis mandatory or infelicitous.A theory of ellipsis has been elusive because to produce an adequate account of this ubiquitous phenomenon one needs to address and integrate data from a wide variety of linguistic research areas. Using data primarily from Russian, English, and Polish, McShane looks at the big picture of ellipsis, integrating the syntactic, semantic, morphological, and pragmatic heuristics and bridges work on ellipsis with the larger study of reference. This is groundbreaking linguistic scholarship that bridges the theoretical and the applied, and will interest scholars in the fields of computational, descriptive, and theoretical linguistics.},

The highly multifaceted nature of 'eat' and 'drink' events gives rise to interesting clausal properties of these predicates, such as the atypicality of transitive constructions involving 'eat' and 'drink' in some languages. The two verbs are also sources for a large number of figurative uses across languages with meanings such as 'destroy', and 'savour', as well as participating in a great variety of idioms which can be quite opaque semantically. Grammaticalized extensions of these predicates also occur, such as the quantificational use of Hausa shaa 'drink' meaning (roughly) 'do X frequently, regularly'. Specialists discuss details of the use of these verbs in a variety of languages and language families: Australian languages, Papuan languages, Athapaskan languages, Japanese, Korean, Hausa, Amharic, Hindi-Urdu, and Marathi.},

It concentrates on transitive structures that contain generic or indefinite object-arguments in Present-day English. A corpus study of 1200 analysed instances was carried out to analyse 'people' and 'stuff' as generic, plural and uncount nouns and 'someone', 'anyone', 'somebody', 'anybody', 'something', 'anything' as indefinite pronouns, occurring in object position. The aims of this corpus study are: a) to investigate to what extent these show reduced transitivity and backgrounded discourse status in the sense of Hopper and Thompson (1980), and b) to show that constructions containing such generic or indefinite object-arguments exhibit characteristics of object demotion and support the emergence of functionally antipassive constructions in Present-Day English.},

After discussing the typological patterns of marking static locations, goals, and sources of motion, I analyze data from Wan, a Southeastern Mande language that often does not encode the distinction between sources and goals either outside of the verb (by adpositions or case) or in the verb's argument structure. In addition to a class of specialized verbs that subcategorize for a particular type of locative argument (``source verbs'' and ``goal verbs''), Wan has a number of verbs that do not restrict their argument to either sources or goals. I show that the two verb classes contrast with respect to the amount of information about the direction of motion that is entailed by the verb's lexical meaning. In encoding the role of the locative argument, the two verb classes rely on di\textcurrency erent strategies: the semantic role is either encoded in the verb's argument structure, or inferred from the interaction of contextual information and the verb's lexical entailments. I demonstrate how the lexical entailments of motion verbs influence their subcategorization pattern and discuss crosslinguistic evidence that supports this analysis.},

Scrutiny of the diagnostic reveals that it actually supports neither of these two central aspects of most constituency grammars. This manuscript demonstrates that the distribution of the pro-verb do so can be accurately characterized in terms of the catena. The catena is a unit of syntactic analysis associated with dependency grammar (DG). It is a more inclusive and versatile unit than the constituency grammar constituent and it is therefore better suited than the constituent to serve as the fundamental unit of syntactic analysis. In the end, the catena-based account of do so delivers support for the flat analysis of (non-finite) VPs.},

Two experiments explore this asymmetry further and test its implications for language production and comprehension. Experiment 1 shows that both adults and 4-year-old children detect fewer within-category changes in source than goal objects when tested for memory of motion events; furthermore, these groups produce fewer references to source than goal objects when describing the same motion events. Experiment 2 asks whether the specificity of encoding source/goal relations differs in both spatial memory and the comprehension of novel spatial vocabulary. Results show that endpoint configuration changes are detected more accurately than source configuration changes by both adults and young children. Furthermore, when interpreting novel motion verbs, both age groups expect more fine-grained lexical distinctions in the domain of endpoint configurations compared to that of source configurations. These studies demonstrate that a cognitive-attentional bias in spatial representation and memory affects both the detail of linguistic encoding during the use of spatial language and the specificity of hypotheses about spatial referents that learners build during the acquisition of the spatial lexicon.},

Our associated software package HaLP provides a practical tool for studying even large and complex HGs. We provide an initial comparison of HG with standard Optimality Theory and with the enriched version allowing local constraint conjunction. This comparison shows that HG has considerable potential as a framework for the study of typology. The availability of HaLP can facilitate the future evaluation of that potential.},

The expression of verbal transitivity in small children begins with the regular use of verbs without their object, even where object omissions are illicit in the ambient language. Grounded in generative grammar and learnability theory, this book presents a comprehensive view of experimental approaches to object acquisition, and is the first to examine how children rely on the lexical, structural and pragmatic components to unravel the system. The results presented lead to the hypothesis that missing objects in child language should not be seen as a deficit but as a continuous process of knowledge integration. The book argues for a new model of how this aspect of grammar is innately represented from birth. Ideal reading for advanced students and researchers in language acquisition and syntactic theory, the book's opening and closing chapters are also suitable for non-specialist readers.},

WordNet, an electronic lexical database, is considered to be the most important resource available to researchers in computational linguistics, text analysis, and many related areas. Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey of representative applications, including word sense identification, information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical chains.

	abstract     = {This work develops a conception of grammar in which optimality with respect to a set of constraints defines well-formedness. The argument begins with a brief assessment of the promise of optimization-based approaches, focusing on issues of explanation from principle. The general lay-out of Optimality Theory is sketched, including the core notions of ranking \&amp; violability and the emphasis on universality in the constraint set.Part I shows how the ideas play out over a variety of phenomena and generalization patterns. The key distinction between Markedness and Faithfulness constraints is introduced. The analytical focus is on empirical phenomena ranging from epenthesis to infixation to a variety of sometimes-complex interactions between prominence, syllabification, stress, and word form. Part I concludes with a formal presentation of the theory.Part II investigates the theory of syllable structure. It begins with a study of the basic Jakobson typology and moves on to present an analysis of aspects of the Lardil phonological system which incorporates the results of the basic theory. The section concludes with a detailed exploration of a generalized theory based on multipolar scales of sonority-to-syllable-position affinity.Part III examines the derivation of universal and language particular inventories, provides discussion of foundational issues, and concludes with analysis of the relation between Optimality Theory and theories using a notion of repair.},

Section 1 reviews the three approaches to determining the number and kind of arguments of a given predicate, as discussed in Karolak (1984), concentrating on the one that is endorsed there. Then, Sections 2\textendash 3 show that the key notions used in this approach have not been \textendash{} and probably cannot be \textendash{} made operational. Moreover, Section 4 briefly reviews some more recent Semantic Syntax work and shows that this lack of operational AAD in Karolak (1984) extends to the SS programme at large. Finally, Section 5 concludes that this deficiency, while common in linguistic theories, is particularly troublesome in the case of SS, which is founded on the notion of predicate-argument structure.},

We address this debate by posing two critical questions: to what extent do humans represent events in terms of abstract role categories, and to what extent are these categories shaped by universal cognitive biases? We review a range of literature that contributes answers to these questions: psycholinguistic and event cognition experiments with adults, children, and infants; typological studies grounded in cross-linguistic data; and studies of emerging sign languages. We pose these questions for a variety of roles and find that the answers depend on the role. For Agents and Patients, there is strong evidence for abstract role categories and a universal bias to distinguish the two roles. For Goals and Recipients, we find clear evidence for abstraction but mixed evidence as to whether there is a bias to encode Goals and Recipients as part of one or two distinct categories. Finally, we discuss the Instrumental role and do not find clear evidence for either abstraction or universal biases to structure instrumental categories.},

Roberge's parameters are so carefully detailed as to allow tests to be drawn up for both first and second language learners. As such, The Syntactic Recoverability of Null Arguments will be of interest not only to syntacticians and dialectologists but also to researchers in the field of language acquisition.},

	abstract     = {Throughout much of the history of linguistics, grammaticality judgments \textendash{} intuitions about the well-formedness of sentences \textendash{} have constituted most of the empirical base against which theoretical hypothesis have been tested. Although such judgments often rest on subtle intuitions, there is no systematic methodology for eliciting them, and their apparent instability and unreliability have led many to conclude that they should be abandoned as a source of data. Carson T. Sch\"utze presents here a detailed critical overview of the vast literature on the nature and utility of grammaticality judgments and other linguistic intuitions, and the ways they have been used in linguistic research. He shows how variation in the judgment process can arise from factors such as biological, cognitive, and social differences among subjects, the particular elicitation method used, and extraneous features of the materials being judged. He then assesses the status of judgments as reliable indicators of a speaker's grammar. Integrating substantive and methodological findings, Sch\"utze proposes a model in which grammaticality judgments result from interaction of linguistic competence with general cognitive processes. He argues that this model provides the underpinning for empirical arguments to show that once extragrammatical variance is factored out, universal grammar succumbs to a simpler, more elegant analysis than judgment data initially lead us to expect. Finally, Sch\"utze offers numerous practical suggestions on how to collect better and more useful data. The result is a work of vital importance that will be required reading for linguists, cognitive psychologists, and philosophers of language alike. "Native speakers' judgments of the acceptability of linguistic examples have always formed a major part of the data of linguistics, but linguists generally either have elicited such data in a haphazard fashion and accepted the results uncritically or have rejected acceptability judgments altogether and equally uncritically. Sch\"utze's book is a welcome relief from the failure of linguists to deal responsibly with what can be either the most fertile or the most misleading source of information about languages."\textemdash James D. McCawley, University of Chicago "Sch\"utze has written an extraordinarily useful and timely book. In it, he provides a clear and readable review of past studies of the methodology of generative syntax. But this is not merely a survey: it is also a call for more careful and objective scientific methods in syntax, including a set of practical methodological suggestions for working syntacticians. If heeded, they will greatly strengthen the empirical base of linguistic theory."\textemdash Tom Wasow, Stanford University},

The mental representations that emerge, Distributed Symbol Systems, have both combinatorial and gradient structure. They are processed through Subsymbolic Optimization\textendash Quantization, in which an optimization process favoring representations that satisfy well-formedness constraints operates in parallel with a distributed quantization process favoring discrete symbolic structures.

There is experimental evidence that both types of constraints are subject to constraint ranking and show cumulativity and ganging up effects. However, soft and hard constraints differ with respect to context effects, crosslinguistic variation, and developmental optionality.

	abstract     = {How does world knowledge interact with syntax to constrain linguistic interpretation? We explored this question by testing children's acquisition of verbs like weed and water, which have opposite meanings despite occurring in the same syntactic frames. Whereas ``weed the garden'' treats ``the garden'' as a source, ``water the garden'' treats it as a goal. In five experiments, we asked how children learn these verbs. Previous theories predict that verbs which describe the transfer of an object with respect to its natural origin (e.g., ``weed the garden'') should receive source interpretations, whereas verbs that describe the transfer of an object with respect to something it is functionally related to (e.g., ``water the garden'') should receive goal interpretations. Therefore, acquiring world knowledge \textendash{} about the natural origins and functional uses of objects \textendash{} should be sufficient for differentiating between source and goal meanings. Experiments 1 and 2 casted doubt on this hypothesis, as 4- and 5-year-olds failed to use their world knowledge when interpreting these verbs and instead overextended goal interpretations. For example, children interpreted ``weed the garden'' to mean ``put weeds onto a garden'', even when they knew the natural origin of weeds. Experiment 3 tested children's interpretation of novel verbs and directly manipulated their access to relevant world knowledge. While younger children continued to exhibit a goal bias and failed to use world knowledge, older children generalized goal and source interpretations to novel verbs according to world knowledge. In Experiments 4 and 5, we confirmed that adults use world knowledge to guide their interpretation of novel verbs, but also showed that even adults prefer goal interpretations when they are made contextually plausible. We argue that children ultimately overcome a goal bias by learning to use their world knowledge to weigh the plausibility of events (e.g., of putting weeds into a garden). \'O 2013 Elsevier B.V.

On the basis of corpus-derived frequency data, we investigate two explanations which have been put forth for this bias: (i) that there is a psychological bias towards goals and purposes of human actions, and (ii) that goal-PPs have a higher information value than other path-PPs and are thus more useful in arriving at a complete conceptualization of a motion event. We show that the second hypothesis makes more accurate predictions about the presence and the extent of the goal bias with different types of motion verbs.},

Furthermore, the role of semantic and pragmatic factors for the positioning of adverbials is disputable. The current paper presents the results of two psycholinguistic experiments that provide evidence for a base position account of frame and sentence adverbials.

First, I show that there are five types of linguistic devices involved in the expression of manner: lexical, syntactic, morphological, grammatical and prosodic ones. Next, I propose a more comprehensive definition of the concept of manner, arguing that it is compositional by nature and by no means monolithic. Finally, adopting Levin and Rappaport Hovav's lexical decomposition approach, I report an in-depth semantic analysis of 562 manner of motion verbs in French and show that manner interpretation in their meaning is generated by a small set of more basic, non-idiosyncratic semantic features which fill a modifier position and whose role consists in diversifying, and thereby in modifying, the root predicate.},

The two kinds of information differ in the nature and degree of connections to encyclopedic world knowledge. This demarcation between the two kinds of information is related to the semantics/ pragmatics distinction, and may be clearly articulated using Krifka's (1992) formalization of a homomorphism from objects to events. Motion verbs, for which the concept of distance plays a crucial role in the gap-filling information, are shown to be special in a number of ways, due to the special properties of distance as encoded in the world knowledge of the speaker. The possible universality of these findings is also discussed.},

Production of six types of verbs was examined in two conditions-a confrontation and an elicited condition; and production of verb arguments was examined in a sentence condition in which each target verb was elicited with all possible argument structure arrangements. Results showed statistically significant differences between the aphasic and non-brain-damaged subjects in all conditions, but no significant differences were found between confrontation and elicited labelling conditions for either subject group. The aphasic subjects, however, produced obligatory one-place verbs correctly significantly more often than three-place or complement verbs in the elicited condition and a consistent hierarchy of verb difficultywas found in both the confrontation and elicited conditions. For both subject groups sentence production was influenced by the number of arguments or participant roles and by the type of arguments required by the verb. In addition, the complexity of the verb (i.e. the number of possible argument structure arrangements) influenced sentence production with simple verbs produced correctly with their arguments more often than complex ones. Finally, obligatory arguments were produced correctly more often than optional ones, even when production of the optional arguments was requested. These data indicate that the argument structure properties of verbs are important dimensions of lexical organization that influence both verb retrieval and sentence production in agrammatic aphasic subjects.},

The present study tests two predictions, made in existing studies, of the influence of this variable. The first is that cue transitivity would influence the grammatical class of responses; the second, that it would affect the directionality of position-based, or syntagmatic, responses. English language associative responses to 49 transitive and 49 intransitive cues were gathered from 53 English L1 respondents. These responses were then analysed according to their grammatical class and categorical designation. Results suggested that cue transitivity influences both of these measurements: transitive cues yielded more noun responses and more associations classified as likely to follow the cue in text than did intransitives, while transitives received more verb responses and more associations likely to precede the cue. These results are discussed in the light of contiguity-based and semantic theories of the determinants of word association.},

We organize the literature on VSMs according to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three broad classes of VSMs, based on term\textendash document, word\textendash context, and pair\textendash pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to provide pointers into the literature for those who are less familiar with the field.},

	abstract     = {Instruments constitute a classic member of the thematic role inventory, yet they are usually analyzed only peripherally, taking a back seat to the more studied members such as Agent and Patient. This dissertation investigates the semantic reality behind the label instrument from the functionalist perspective of Role \& Reference Grammar. Starting from a theoretical investigation of what instrumentality truly means when contrasted with related concepts like comitatives, this book explores the morphosyntactic realization of instruments across a wide range of typologically diverse languages. Apart from the standard occurrences of instruments that come to mind from languages such as Latin, German or English, this book delves into several less common constructions that feature the instrument relation. Such constructions include, amongst others, passives with instruments and particularly the Instrument-Subject Alternation, a construction where the instrument seemingly appears as the subject of the sentence. This construction displays variation along three dimensions: 1) The instrument can vary from a very simple tool to a complicated machine, 2) the predicate can vary substantially and 3) languages differ widely with respect to the construction?s acceptability. This makes for a complex playing field where the animacy of the instrument but also the aktionsart class of the predicate play a major role. The last section of this book deals with linking the semantics of instruments and related concepts to their morphosyntactic realizations, including the various encoding strategies that are available in any given language. 0.},

This approach naturally leads to a system able to capture degrees of deviance: the relative acceptability of an intervention configuration will vary as a function of the total, partial or zero featural overlap between the intervener and the target. In a nutshell, configurations involving a lesser degree of featural overlap should be more acceptable than sentences involving a higher degree of overlap. Three acceptability judgment experiments systematically investigated predictions ensuing from Featural Relativized Minimality in extraction from weak islands. Four configurations of feature overlap were systematically tested with different methods of data collection and on a large set of linguistically na\"ive participants. Results from the three experiments are highly consistent in returning that predictions from Featural Relativized Minimality are globally borne out, except for the configuration involving two lexically restricted wh-elements, for which tentative explanations in terms of grammar or processing are sketched out.},

One problem is posed by the ambiguity between locative prepositional phrases as arguments of a verb or adjuncts. As the semantics for the verb is the same in both cases, it is difficult to differentiate them, and to learn the appropriate subcategorisation frame. We propose an approach that uses semantically motivated preposition selection and frequency information to determine if a locative PP is an argument or an adjunct. In order to test this approach, we perform an experiment using a computational learning system that receives as input utterances annotated with logical forms. The results obtained indicate that the learner successfully distinguishes between arguments (obligatory and optional) and adjuncts.},

I argue that both particles and prefixes come in two types, non-scalar and scalar, depending on how they describe the change denoted in the verb root. Non-scalar particles and prefixes do not alter argument structure, e.g. The children walked (on) in silence. They appear in predicates without an underlying scale, which are consequently atelic. In contrast, scalar particles and prefixes appear in predicates with an underlying scale, which are potentially telic. Scalar prefixes and particles can alter argument structure because scales require an obligatory realization of the measured participant, e.g. Ally slept *(off) a headache. The study reviews manifestations of argument-structure alternations as well as factors that determine the effect of particles and prefixes on telicity.},

These semantic formulae, which account for differences both in acceptability (have a drink and *have an eat) and in meaning (drink and have a drink), are stated not in terms of ad-hoc features or labels, but in an independently justified semantic metalanguage based on natural language.},

The consequences of these results for lexical association vs. featurebased thematic fit models are discussed, and suggestions are made for how future research might test feature-based and lexical-based versions of probabilistic constraint models of syntactic processing.},
