% To cite someone \cite{Visscher2008,James2013}, \textcite{Visscher2008,James2013}, \parencite{Visscher2008,James2013} is very simple: just 
% use the \Command{sidecite}\index{\Command{sidecite}} command. It does 
% not have an offset argument yet, but it probably will in the future. 
% This command supports multiple entries, as you can see, and by default 
% it prints the reference on the margin as well as adding it to the 
% bibliography at the end of the document. Note that the citations have 
% nothing to do with the text, \sidecite{James2013} but they are completely 
% random as they only serve the purpose to illustrate the feature.
