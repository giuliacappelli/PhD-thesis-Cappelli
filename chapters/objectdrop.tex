Definite or indefinite: discrete accounts -- Fillmore (1969)’s seminal work

% *Liu (2008: 296)*  
% > As Rutherford (1998:191) correctly points out, “Verbs
% exhibiting surface characteristics of intransitivity, however, are a mixed bag and can
% be distinguished syntactically and/or semantically.”

%  *Liu (2008: 289)*
%  tutto il paper riguarda questa distinzione in gruppi per transitività  
%  > verbs used without an object into four categories: 1) pure intransitive verbs, such as
% arrive, rise, and sleep; 2) ergative intransitive verbs, such as break, increase, and open; 3)
% transitive-converted intransitive verbs of activity, such as eat, hunt, and read; 4) object deleting
% verbs, warranted by discourse or situational context, such as know, notice, and
% promise.

% *Medina (2007: 13)*
% > The indefinite implicit object construction is to be distinguished here, as much as possible, from 
% definite implicit objects which are defined here to be objects in which the speaker does need to have 
% the specific identity of the object in mind.This distinction serves to distinguish implicit objects whose 
% particular meaning can be recovered from the preceding discourse or disambiguating physical context 
% (definite implicit objects) from implicit objects whose meaning is recoverable only from the verb in the
%  sentence (indefinite implicit objects)

% *Petho & Kardos (2006: 30)*  
% > so-called indefinite null complements (INC) and definite null complements (DNC). This
% distinction was introduced by Fillmore (1986), and aims to capture a semantic difference between
% two types of verbs. Indefinite null complements (i.e. implicit objects) of verbs receive an
% “existentially quantified” interpretation, e.g. I am eating approximately means ‘I am eating
% something’, but not ‘I am eating it.’. On the other hand, a definite null complement is interpreted
% anaphorically and must therefore have an appropriate antecedent in context to make sense

% *Garcia-Velasco & Munoz (2002: 7-8)*  
% IMPORTANTE APPUNTO SULLA RECOVERABILITY! e sulla world knowledge!  
% > The fact the phenomenon is influenced by two types of factors (lexical and
% discoursive) has led some scholars to suggest the existence of two corresponding types of
% argument omission: contextual and lexical omission. This distinction is first introduced in
% Allerton (1975), to be taken over and developed by Fillmore (1986) and Groefsema (1995).
% Fillmore establishes an interesting distinction between definite null complements (DNC),
% which basically correspond to Allerton’s contextual omission and indefinite null complements
% (INC). Fillmore (1986: 96) employs the following test to distinguish the two categories:  
% << One test for the INC/DNC distinction has to do with determining whether it would sound odd for a speaker to
% admit ignorance of the identity of the referent of the missing phrase. It’s not odd to say things like, “He was
% eating; I wonder what he was eating”; but it is odd to say things like “They found out; I wonder what they found
% out.” The missing object of the surface-intransitive verb EAT is indefinite; the missing object of the surface-
% intransitive verb FIND OUT is definite. The point is that one does not wonder about what one already knows.>>  
% The distinction is then based on the possibility of recovering the missing element. INC verbs
% do not allow recoverability from the context. [...]  
% It seems that those verbs which allow the transition from accomplishment to activity might
% correspond to IO-verbs. That is, the IO type of omission can be considered to be lexical in
% nature, and therefore influenced by both the type and nature of the verbal object and the
% semantic class of the verb itself. [...]  
% The factors of relevance here include the semantic structure of the verb, which
% itself may give prominence to one semantic component (as in the manner-result opposition),
% the speaker’s communicative intentions, which may lead him to focus on the activity itself,
% thus downgrading the referential status of the object, and world knowledge, which allows him
% to construe an action as an autonomous activity

% *Tonelli & Delmonte (2011: 55 sgg.)*  
% IMPORTANTE: TERMINI-OMBRELLO PER DEFINITE+INDEFINITE OBJ DROP  
% > In this work, we focus on null complements, also
% called pragmatically controlled zero anaphora (Fill-
% more, 1986), understood arguments or linguistically
% unrealized arguments [...]  
%  definite null complements or instantia-
% tions (DNI) and are lexically specific in that they ap-
% ply only to some predicates.  
%  indefinite null complements or instantiations (INI) and
% are constructionally licensed in that they apply to
% any predicate in a particular grammatical construc-
% tion.

% *Eu (2018: 523)*
% >  Allerton (1975) and Fillmore (1986) understand omitted objects as being indefinite, by which they mean
% that omitted objects are unknown and insulated from their potential referents available
% in the context. However, this squib presents data that challenge this understanding of
% indefiniteness, and proposes that the indefiniteness of omitted objects may be more
% precisely understood as their indeterminacy over their potential referents. [...]  
% Omitted objects
% are ‘semantically obligatory’ (Somers 1984: 510), and yet object omission is generally
% distinguished from the phenomenon where an object is missing on the surface but
% ‘recoverable’ from the context. The difference between the two types of missing
% objects, however, has not been clearly explained, and this squib investigates this
% difference to gain a more precise view of object omission.
% Allerton (1975) and Fillmore (1986) explain the difference in terms of definiteness:
% omitted objects are indefinite in reference, while recoverable objects are definite.

% *Eu (2018: 524)*
% > For Fillmore and Allerton, however, the unknownness of INC-objects does not
% mean that they are known only as the abstract semantic role assigned to the object.
% Rather, they note that INC-objects are often understood in ‘semantic specialization’,
% for instance, as ‘a meal’ as in (4a), ‘alcoholic beverages’ as in (4b), and ‘breads or
% pastries’ as in (4c):  
% (4) (a) We’ve already eaten.  
% (b) I’ve tried to stop drinking.  
% (c) I spent the afternoon baking.  
% (Fillmore 1986: 96–7)

% *Eu (2018: 525)*
% > The question, then, is how semantic specialization differs from the knownness of
% DNC-objects. Allerton (1975: 218) answers this by saying: ‘the sentence: John’s been
% drinking again may imply a particular KIND of object, but it does not refer to one
% established as DEFINITE contextually’. In other words, semantically specialized INC-
% objects always refer to a category, or ‘a particular KIND of object’, and never a specific
% instance of the category, while DNC-objects refer to specific individuals in the context.

% *Eu (2018: 525)*
% > Indefiniteness as unknownness, however, is challenged by cases where INC-objects
% fairly clearly refer to a specific individual in the context. Groefsema (1995: 142, 44)
% introduces (5a, b) against Fillmore’s comment on (3a) and says that here eat and drink
% do take the contextual referents (sandwiches, glass of beer) as their objects, although
% the amount eaten or drunk is ‘unspecified’:
% (5) (a) John brought the sandwiches and Ann ate.
% (b) John picked up the glass of beer and drank.
% (Groefsema 1995: 142, 144)

% *Eu (2018: 527)*
% >  The point here is that INC-objects themselves do not fix the actual referent
% as the obvious one; hence, whenever the context is flexible enough as in (5a–d), it is
% possible to dissociate the actual referent from the obvious one without sounding odd.
% In contrast, DNC-objects require a clear and fixed referent. So in all contexts if the
% actual referent is different from what the hearer expects on the basis of the context, the
% object cannot be deleted; therefore, if an object is deleted as a DNC-object, the actual
% referent cannot differ from the obvious referent no matter how flexible the context may
% be. The referents of DNC-objects are determinate.

% *Ruppenhofer & Michaelis (2010: 159)*  
% > Fillmore (1986) distinguishes two major types of null comple-
% ments, definite and indefinite, based on the potential for a discourse antecedent,
% and Goldberg (2006: Chapter 9) uses the discourse prominence of participants to
% explain why constructions like the English experiential perfect license argument
% omissions that are not allowable in episodic contexts (e.g., She has never failed to
% impress Ø ).

% *Stark & Meier (2018: 11)*  
% > Cummins/Roberge (2004). In their qualitative analysis of object drop in French,
% they distinguish two types of null objects (NOs): “internally-licensed Null Objects” and
% “referential” Null Objects.

% *Stark & Meier (2018: 13)*  
% > This kind of null topic [referential null objects] is controlled pragmatically according to Raposo (1986, 375), i. e.
% it has either to be given linguistically, in the preceding context, or extralinguistically, in
% the situational context.

% *Ahringberg (2015: 9)*  
% > Fillmore (1986, p. 103) further recognizes several complement constructions that may be
% omitted as definite null complements, including lexical noun phrase direct objects, indicative
% that-clause direct objects, subjunctive that-clause direct objects, and prepositional phrase
% complements of transitive verbs, to name a few.

% *Dvorak (2017: 117)*  
% >  The terms were coined by Fillmore (1969, 1986), but the distinction itself goes
% back even further, to Katz and Postal (1964) who distinguished between the deletion of
% it versus something at the level of D-structure. Fillmore (1969) proposed that it has to
% be specified for each predicate whether it can have a null complement with an indfefinite
% interpretation, or with a definite interpretation. Fraser and Ross (1970) assume that the null
% object of Max read / Max is reading undergoes ‘unspecified object deletion’, which makes
% it different from the null object of the verbs like I approved / I began / I insisted, which
% has an anaphoric interpretation. 

% *Dvorak (2017: 118)*  
% > Fillmore (1986) reinforces the lexicon-based view of ‘indefinite null complements’ by
% saying that they are “limited to particular lexically defined environments”, such as the
% object slot of verbs like eat, read, sing, cook, sew, bake (Fillmore 1986:95). He suggests that
% these verbs, when used intransitively, have an understood object that could be paraphrased
% as stuff. The referential identity of such an object is unknown, or a matter of indifference,
% as shown by the follow-up clause in (200-a). On the other hand, ‘definite null complements’
% correspond to something that is already known from the context, so they do not allow the
% same continuation (see (200-b)).  
% (200) a. He was eating; I wonder what he was eating.  
% b. #They found out; I wonder what they found out.  
%  Fillmore 1986:96  
% He is also aware that in some highly restricted mini-genres, the possibility of object omission
% is much higher: Store in a cool place, Shake before using, Keep out of reach of children. For
% a recent take on these special registers, see Ruda 2014.

% *Melchin (2019: 53-54)*  
% > The understood objects of verbs that have undergone UOA are interpreted as indefi-
% nite masses or plurals. For their indefinite status, I give evidence from AnderBois (2012).
% AnderBois notes that the understood objects may not be coreferential with any previous
% discourse referents. [...] The unavailability of coreferential interpretations is a property of indefinite DPs; definite
% DPs (including personal pronouns) typically corefer with other referents in the discourse.

%  *Cote (1996: 110)*
%  > an examination of English null objects leads one into the murky waters of the distinction between arguments of verbs and information available from world
% knowledge about events.

%  *Cote (1996: 113)*
% > null objects found in (3) and (4) which occur with a different set of verbs and which may not co-refer with a discourse antecedent, but which do seem to create a discoure
% entity available for subsequent reference. Following previous work, I refer to the verbs that take this type of null object as Indefinite Object Alternation (IOA) verbs.


% *Liu (2008: 290)*  
% in risposta a quelli che dicono che non c'è differenza tra INDEFINITE object deletion e DEFINITE obj del  
% (dovrei avere una cosa del genere negli appunti, ma dove??)
% > For example, without any contextual
% information preceding or following the sentence Mary read for a while before she
% went to bed, it is impossible to decide whether a specific object, like a book or a magazine,
% has been deleted after the verb read. Making this distinction is important
% because whether a specific object has been deleted determines whether the verb is
% used as an intransitive verb focusing on activity or as an instance of object deletion,
% a distinction that, as I will argue later in this paper, should and can be made.

% *Liu (2008: 293)*  
% corrobora il punto precedente  
% > As some linguists (e.g., Garcia-Velasco & Munoz 2002; Quirk et al. 1985) have
% correctly pointed out, in the case of the second type, the shift of the verbs’ function
% from transitive to intransitive often involves a change in the focus of meaning, i.e.,
% the focus turns from the object in the transitive use to the activity (the verb) itself in
% the intransitive use. There is no such semantic shift in the object-deleting verbs’ shift
% from transitive to intransitive.

% *Liu (2008: 300)*  
% > two groups. For instance, Quirk et al. (1985:1565) list both the ergative and the
% transitive-converted intransitive verbs as instances of “transitive → intransitive.”
% There are three significant differences between the two groups of verbs. First, the
% subject or the sole argument of an ergative verb plays the theta role of theme, but the
% sole argument of a transitive-converted intransitive verb plays the theta role of agent
% (e.g., The window broke vs. Mary ate). Second, while there is a subject change in the
% use of an ergative intransitive verb compared to its transitive counterpart (e.g., from
% They opened the door to The door opened), no such a change is involved in the use
% of a transitive-turned intransitive verb [...]  
% The third difference between the two groups is that there is no object deletion
% involved at all in ergative intransitive verbs when they shift from transitive to intransitive
% because the shift entails only a movement of the object into the subject position,
% i.e., the object is not deleted, just moved to a different position in the sentence. [...]  
% Of course, some scholars argue that there are a few instances
% in which a transitive-converted intransitive verb of activity may assume “a more specific
% meaning, so a particular kind of object is ‘understood’” (Quirk et al. 1985:1169).
% An example given by Quirk et al. is John drinks heavily. They suggest that the verb
% drink in the utterance means ‘drink alcohol,’ i.e., alcohol is the omitted object. While
% it is true that drink here means ‘drink alcohol,’ the focus of the utterance, in the final
% analysis, is not on the object because it does not really refer to any specific kind or
% amount of alcoholic drink, something that is usually mentioned if the focus is on the
% object. In short, transitive-turned-intransitive verbs of activity focus on the activity,
% not the object.4

% *Liu (2008: 302)*  
% > The third compelling reason to consider these verbs intransitive verbs of activity
% is that they can function meaningfully without a clear discourse or situational context
% as shown in the following BNC examples:  
% (26) She likes to read.  
% (27) The python has already eaten.  
% (28) She might have been drinking.  
% In contrast, true object-deleting verbs, such as know, promise, and understand,
% cannot be used this way

% *AnderBois (2012: 44)*
% >  two properties which distinguish overt indefinites
% and definites in English: the possibility of apparently anaphoric readings (§2.1) and the ability to serve
% as the inner antecedent for Sluicing (§2.2) [...]  
% Sluicing is the name given by Ross (1969) to the phenomenon in (7) in which the crossed out
% material can be elided in the presence of a suitable antecedent clause in prior discourse:  
% (7) [ Someone left]A , but I don’t know [who left]E .

Neither definite nor indefinite: continuous accounts

% *Olsen & Resnik (1997: 1)*
% > Early accounts eliminate the object from the syntax via an "object
% deletion" transformation (Katz and Postal 1964, Browne, 1971). More recent
% work has observed that implicit object constructions have aspectual constraints
% (Mittwoch 1982, Brisson 1994) and that omitted objects must be "typical,"
% inferable, or partially specified by the semantics of the verb (Brisson 1994,
% Fellbaum and Kegl 1989, Lehrer 1970, Mittwoch 1982, Rice 1988). Recently
% Resnik (1996) has substantiated and formalized the inferability claim using an
% information-theoretic account of selectional constraints. In this paper we show
% that the aspectual and selectional criteria for implicit objects are accounted for
% within the framework described by Hopper and Thompson's (1980; H&T)
% transitivity hypothesis. We locate English implicit object constructions on a
% continuum of transitivity, with indefinite implicit object constructions (1a) closer
% to intransitives, and definite implicit object constructions (1b) closer to transitives.

% *Olsen & Resnik (1997: 2)*
% > According to H&T, clauses that
% show telic aspect and individuated objects are more transitive than those with
% atelic aspect and nonindividuated objects. Furthermore, if aspect and
% individuation covary, telicity and high individuation should occur together in
% transitive clauses, and atelicity and low individuation together in intransitive
% clauses. 

% *Glass (2013: 1)*  
% UTILI CONSIDERAZIONI TEORICHE E BIBLIOGRAFICHE  
% > I'll sketch the scope of these data before I turn to the analysis. Although the literature (e.g.,
% Fillmore1986) distinguishes between “indefinite” and “definite” IOs, I have some qualms about
% this distinction, which I elaborate later on (see also Anderbois 2012, Scott 2006). Therefore, I
% consider data from both sides of this distinction. However, I limit myself to IOs that seem to
% stand in for DP’s (rather than CP’s). I also don't take a stand on whether IOs are represented in the
% semantics, as in e.g., Anderbois (2012), or whether the verbs are simply intransitive and a patient
% argument (the thing eaten) is pragmatically inferred (as in Recanati 2007); the term “IO” is de-
% scriptive only.


% *AnderBois (2012: 43)*
% > Dating back to Fillmore (1969)’s seminal work, the literature on implicit arguments (IAs) has
% consistently distinguished two types of IAs : those which can be paraphrased with an overt indefinite, as
% in (1a)1 , and those which are better paraphrased with a pronoun or definite description, such as (1b).  
% (1) a. John ate [THEME].  ⇐ Indefinite Implicit Argument  
% b. Maribel noticed [S TATE O F A FFAIRS ]. ⇐ Definite Implicit Argument [...]  
% a third category, to which we give the descriptive moniker flexible IAs. As we will show below, flexible
% IAs appear to pattern with definite IAs on some occasions and indefinite IAs on others.  
% (2) The Giants won [CONTEST]. ⇐ Flexible Implicit Argument

% CFR. ANDERBOIS 2012 SUBITO SOPRA IN QUESTO NOTEBOOK!  
% > Larjavaara’s generic/latent distinction is based on
% the ability of the hearer to identify a possible referent. Lambrecht and
% Lemoine’s categories of indefinite (those that cannot refer to an entity in the
% discourse) and definite (those that must be interpreted as referring to an entity
% in the discourse) capture a similar distinction, and they add a third
% category—ÔÔlibreÕÕ (ÔfreeÕ)—to handle the indeterminate cases.

% *Naess (2007: 130-134)*
% CONTINUOUS ACCOUNT SU BASE PRAGMATICA
% CRITICA DI QUESTA COSA --> TORNA BENE CON IL MIO "CONTINUUM GRADATUM"
% In a departure from the traditional approach based on verb semantics, Goldberg
% (2001) analyses IOD as essentially a discourse-pragmatic phenomenon. Her start-
% ing-point is the data presented in (6.1) above, which demonstrate that in the right
% context, just about any transitive verb in English can be used without an object.
% In order to account for these data, Goldberg introduces the notion of discourse
% prominence, which subsumes both topic and focus. An argument that is either
% topical or focal is discourse-prominent, and English generally requires discourse-
% prominent arguments to be expressed. In the typical situation the patient argument
% of a causative verb is a highly prominent one (cf. 3.2.2); “one typically does not as- --  
% sert that a participant changes state unless one wishes to discuss or draw attention
% to that participant” (Goldberg 2001 :510). Nevertheless, a patient of a causative
% verb which is neither topical nor focal, and therefore has low discourse promi-
% nence, may be omitted under the further condition that the action is emphasised.
% Emphasis on the action can take a number of forms; iteration, discussed earlier, is
% one possibility, but there are others. Goldberg among others mentions that the ac-
% tion can be the discourse topic, as in the example He was always opposed to the idea
% of murder, but in the middle of the battlefield, he had no trouble killing; or an action
% can be emphasised by the speaker’s strong affective stance toward the action, as in
% Why would they give this creep a light prison term? He murdered!
% Goldberg concludes that patient arguments can be omitted when they are
% deemphasised vis à vis the action. This leaves her with the cases of apparently
% lexically conditioned omission – the familiar “core set” of IOD verbs like drink,
% smoke, sing, bake, read, eat, which frequently omit their objects even when none of
% the above-mentioned trappings of “action emphasis” are present. She states that
% intuitively there does appear to be a stronger emphasis on the action in Pat read in
% the car than in Pat read a book in the car, but does not attempt to explain or sub-
% stantiate this intuition. Instead, she notes that this set of verbs frequently appears
% in generic contexts with a habitual interpretation: Pat drinks; Pat smokes; Chris
% sings; Sam bakes. As this usage is licensed by her discourse-prominence analysis,
% she assumes that the frequent usage of these verbs in such contexts has led to a
% grammaticalisation of object omission as a lexical option for these verbs.
% There are two main difficulties with this analysis. Firstly, it is unclear exactly
% what the condition of “emphasis on the action” should be taken to include. There
% are instances where object omission is possible but where it is not clear that there
% is any intended emphasis on the action as such. In a sentence like John murdered
% for the money, no iteration is necessarily implied; John might perfectly well have
% committed just one murder for the purposes of financial gain. But neither does the
% action as such seem to be emphasised in any other way; if anything, the emphasis
% here seems to be on John’s motivation for performing the act in question rather
% than on the action itself, and in fact the NP specifying this motivation may take
% contrastive stress: John murdered for MONEY, not for love. This goes against Gold-
% berg’s claim that emphasis on the action as such is required, rather than just the
% presence of some focal element other than the patient (p. 513).
% Secondly, the attempt to locate the properties licensing IOD exclusively at the
% level of discourse leads to a rather vague and unsatisfactory account of the in-
% stances where IOD does seem to be related to verbal semantics. There is no expla-
% nation for why just the sort of verbs cited by Goldberg (note that all of these are
% either affected-agent or effected-object verbs) should be so frequent in generic/ha-
% bitual contexts as to grammaticalise the possibility of IOD. Furthermore, it is sim- --  
% ply not true that all of these verbs are frequent in “generic contexts with a habitual
% interpretation”. The most frequently-cited IOD verb of them all, ‘eat’, is highly un-
% natural in a generic/habitual sentence: ??John eats. Similarly, the generic/habitual
% construction with drink only applies when drink is understood to mean ‘drink al-
% cohol’; if taken to mean something like ‘John habitually imbibes liquids’, ??John
% drinks is just as peculiar as ??John eats. It is not obvious, therefore, how the pro-
% posed grammaticalisation of the possibility of IOD would have come about with
% these verbs; and the question also arises of exactly where the ‘drink alcohol’ mean-
% ing of objectless ‘drink’ comes from (see 6.3.3 below).

% *Naess (2007: 134)*
% > Structurally, the most obvious characteristic of the indefinite object deletion construction is
% that it is a formally intransitive clause, as opposed to the transitive construction
% which appears when the verb in question is used with ano overt object NP. The
% logical explanation to such an alternation between higher vs. lower formal transi-
% tivity would be that it reflects a corresponding difference in semantic transitivity.
% From this perspective, IOD is most felicitously analysed not as a lexical quirk
% of certain specific verbs or classes of verbs, but as a syntactic detransitivisation
% mechanism, a means of expressing in a formally intransitive clause events which
% are construed as deviating from the transitive prototype.

% *Naess (2007: 135)*  
% IMPORTANTISSIMO!!! SI RICOLLEGA AL DISCORSO DI DRINK=ALCOHOL ETC  
% > Analysing IOD as a construction which applies only to verbs or clauses which
% are not fully transitive semantically explains a striking observation made by Fill-
% more (1986): certain verbs undergo what he calls a semantic “specialisation” when
% used in an IOD context. He cites the verb bake as an example: in the sentence I
% spent the afternoon baking, “the missing object is taken to include breads or pas-
% tries, but not potatoes or hams” (Fillmore 1986 :96).
% If we take into consideration the difference in semantic transitivity between
% affected-object and effected-object verbs, an explanation for this “semantic spe-
% cialisation” is readily forthcoming. The verb bake in English is ambiguous between
% an affected-object (bake potatoes, where the potatoes already existed prior to the
% action and are only affected, not effected by the act of baking) and an effected-ob-
% ject reading (bake pastries, where the act of baking brings the pastries into exist-
% ence). Affected-object bake is high in transitivity and so does not easily undergo
% IOD. Effected-object bake, on the other hand, unproblematically omits its object,
% because this verb has a nonreferential, nonaffected object and therefore is not ful-
% ly transitive semantically. Consequently, under IOD, only the effected-object read-
% ing is possible – the intransitive construction can only be read as containing a verb
% relatively low in transitivity.
% Similar behaviour can be found e.g. with the ambiguous verb paint in generic/
% habitual statements. If we say of someone that He paints, we mean that he paints
% pictures – either for a living or as a hobby – not that he is a housepainter.

% *Naess (2007: 136)*  
% > The IOD construction with a purpose clause – John murdered for the money –
% does not necessarily have an iterative reading, as pointed out above. Rather, such
% clauses are construable as a kind of affected-agent construction where the affected-
% agent reading is not imposed by the semantics of the verb, but rather by the pur-
% pose clause. A statement of the agent’s motivation or purpose in performing an act
% is essentially a statement of the benefits that the agent hopes to achieve in acting;
% in other words the intended effect of the act on the agent. Affectedness of the
% agent, then, is not necessarily inherent to the semantics of a specific verb, but may
% be introduced by other elements of a clause.


\subsection{A working definition of "indefinite object drop"}

citare Medina e tutta la teoria possibile che la conforti
è una definizione pre-teoretica che prescinde dalle proiezioni sintattiche?
QUI METTERE IL MIO DIAGRAMMA DI VENN CONCENTRICO

% *Naess (2007: 124-125)*
% > In this chapter, the term “indefinite object deletion” (IOD) will be used to describe
% the situation where a verb which allows an argument which syntactically must be
% characterised as a direct object is employed without any overt direct-object argu-
% ment. We will restrict the discussion to cases of so-called context-independent
% object deletion.
% Many languages allow omission of objects whose reference is expected to be
% retrievable from context. Such context-dependent object deletion may take place
% when the object in question has already been mentioned in the previous discourse,
% or where the general context provides sufficient clues as to the identity [...]  
% By contrast, context-independent object deletion does not depend on the ref-
% erent of the missing object being retrievable or identifiable by the hearer. In order
% to correctly understand a sentence such as He is eating, it is not necessary to be
% able to infer what is being eaten; in fact, there is no expectation whatsoever that
% the referent of the object should be identifiable. This is not to say that the use of the
% verb eat without an object does not imply that an object is present; the act of eating
% unquestionably presupposes that something is eaten. However, it is only this pres-
% ence of an object in general that must be inferred by the hearer in such cases: the
% hearer knows that something is being eaten, but is not expected to be able to iden-
% tify which specific edible object is being referred to. [...]  
% Some approaches assume a further division between contexts where objects
% are omitted because they are obvious and contexts where they are omitted because
% they are indefinite. For example, Heath (1976a) claims that in the sentence He
% drinks, “the T[ransitive] O[bject] is deleted because it is obvious in the context,
% rather than because of indefiniteness. On the other hand, in the type Speed kills the
% deleted TO is indefinite rather than obvious”.
% It is not clear, however, how the object of He drinks can be “obvious in the
% context” when the sentence is in fact presented without any context whatsoever.
% The only way to interpret this would seem to be that the object is “obvious in the
% context of deletion”, that is, it is obvious because it is deleted; the very fact that no
% object is present allows us to assign it the “obvious” interpretation. But this is a
% circular argument: the object is deleted because it is obvious, and it is obvious be-
% cause it is deleted. No such difference between “obvious” and “indefinite” deleted
% objects will be assumed here.

% element with indefinite value. We will refer to this view as the covert indefinite view
% (CIV). The other view, which we call the genuine-intransitive view (GIV), assigns
% two distinct (though related) lexical entries to transitive and intransitive ‘eat’.

% *Naess (2007: 130-134)*  
% ## CONTRO LA DISTINZIONE IN DUE DIVERSE ENTRATE LESSICALI
% Rather than focus on the relations between individual verbs and the types of
% objects they typically take, a number of approaches to IOD appeal to event-struc-
% ture analyses along the lines of Vendlerian semantics. Mittwoch (1982) character-
% ises intransitive ‘eat’ as an activity and transitive ‘eat’ as an accomplishment, thus
% supporting on event-semantic grounds the view that the two uses of ‘eat’ must on
% some level be analysed as involving two separate lexical items. Van Valin and La-
% Polla (1997) similarly assume a distinction between an “activity” and an “active
% accomplishment” reading of verbs such as ‘eat’, where the activity version has a
% nonreferential second argument which is not instantiated as a semantic macrorole
% in the verb’s logical structure, whereas the active accomplishment version has two
% macrorole arguments (Van Valin and LaPolla 1997 :148–150). Van Valin and La-
% Polla’s analysis of ‘eat’ was discussed in 4.5.
% In Brisson (1994), a case is made for two distinct classes of verbs permitting
% IOD (in Brisson’s terms, verbs allowing unspecified objects): “write verbs”, exam-
% ples of which are write, knit, bake, draw, paint, sew, drink, type, dig, and eat; and
% “sweep verbs” such as sweep, plow, pack, dust, vacuum, clean, mow and rake – study
% and read are given in parentheses as atypical examples of this class because they
% behave like these verbs under some, but not all, conditions.
% In brief and somewhat simplified terms, Brisson’s argument is that the sweep
% verbs are not true accomplishment verbs (among other things, she argues that they
% do not necessarily entail a result state, and they can take adverbs of duration with-
% out acquiring an iterative reading) and that this accounts for their ability to occur
% without an overt object, a claim essentially parallel to that made for ‘eat’ by Van
% Valin and LaPolla to the effect that the second argument of activity predicates is
% qualitatively different from that of accomplishment predicates, and therefore omis-
% sible. The write verbs, on the other hand, are accomplishment verbs proper and
% therefore require a different account.
% However, Brisson is not able to provide such an account, beyond proposing
% that write verbs do not really “delete” their objects but rather have two distinct
% variants represented in the lexicon, one intransitive activity verb and one transitive
% accomplishment verb. With respect to the intransitive activity verbs, she discusses ---  
% whether there is not in fact an “implicit argument” present; does not John wrote
% seem to entail that he wrote something? However, she claims that this may not be
% relevant and that “the assumption that ‘something’ was written might be related to
% real world knowledge” (Brisson 1994 :99).
% The appeal to real-world knowledge appears rather ad hoc in this case, as it is
% not clear why this would apply only to the write verbs. If the assumption that
% something is written is attributable to real-world knowledge, why would the as-
% sumption that something is swept require a different analysis? If the interpretation
% of objectless clauses depends on real-world knowledge in some cases, could this
% not be generalised to all cases, making all further analysis superfluous?
% A further problem with this analysis is that it produces a complicated and
% rather vague account of the verb eat, which has traditionally been considered one
% of the most central instances of the IOD phenomenon. Eat in this account is clas-
% sified with the write verbs, but behaves rather differently from the rest of this class
% when used intransitively: “monadic eat seems to strongly suggest that a meal has
% been eaten in the unmarked case: John ate means that he ate dinner, or lunch, or
% whatever may constitute a meal in John’s diet. This completive sense is in strong
% contrast to the monadic write verbs: John wrote does not have any such completive
% sense. However, it is still possible to obtain a “pure” activity reading for monadic
% eat, as in John ate for ten minutes. It is likely that monadic eat would have to be
% lexically marked to account for these properties” (Brisson 1994 :100).
% An analysis in terms of event structure, then, cannot account for the fact that
% a number of presumed accomplishment verbs are frequent in the IOD construc-
% tion, beyond claiming that such verbs occur in two distinct lexical variants. It also
% has difficulties in accounting for the behaviour of ‘eat’ under IOD, which will be
% further discussed in 6.3.3.

\paragraph{Inherent objects}
testo

% *Naess (2007: 130-134)* 
% Rice appeals to the notion of prototypical complement of a verb: there is, she
% claims, a basic-level NP which is evoked as the understood object when a verb is
% used without an overt object NP: “Clearly, an omitted object should not be read as
% zero. Rather, on a neutral reading, an omission activates a prototype or a particular
% semantic frame in which the action is prototypical” (Rice 1988 :204). This assump-
% tion is meant to account for the fact that the presence of an object is implied with
% IOD constructions, even though no specific reference is assigned to it.
% The notion of a prototypical complement, however, begs the question of how
% one determines, for a given verb, which possible complement is “prototypical”.
% One of Rice’s examples of such a verb is drink, which is assumed to have the pro-
% totypical complement ‘alcohol’. On this analysis, the fact that the English verb
% drink may be used without an object is a consequence of this verb having a proto-
% typical object associated with it, and this prototypical object is recoverable from
% the objectless sentence, giving the reading of John drinks as John drinks alcohol.
% The question is, apart from the fact that objectless drink in English (and many ---  
% other languages) has this reading, what is the evidence for alcohol being a proto-
% typical object of drink? In the daily life of most people, a typical act of drinking
% does not involve alcohol, and it is not clear why such a specialised notion as that of
% ingesting intoxicating fluids should be “prototypical” with respect to the everyday
% concept of drinking things in general. Without any independent justification, such
% an assumption is circular: Object NPs may be omitted if they represent “proto-
% typical complements” of the verb in question, and since in English objectless drink
% is generally interpreted as meaning ‘drink alcohol’, ‘alcohol’ must be the prototypi-
% cal object of ‘drink’.

% *Garcia-Velasco & Munoz (2002: 4)*  
% >  it is not only the presence/absence of a verbal object that allows
% the transition from an activity to an accomplishment reading with some verbs. When the
% verbal object is non-specific, indefinite or generic, it is possible to obtain the same effect:  
% (3) a. He ate a plate of spaghetti in ten minutes (accomplishment)  
% b. He ate spaghetti for ten minutes (activity)  
% Van Valin & LaPolla (1997) note that this situation is frequent with verbs of creation or
% consumption. According to the authors (1997: 122), the second argument in activity
% predicates does not show referential properties, which usually imparts a generic or habitual
% interpretation to the predication. [...]  
% On the basis of these observations, the authors make the following claim (1997: 122-123):  
% << Thus, the second argument with an activity verb like eat will be called an INHERENT ARGUMENT, an
% argument which expresses an intrinsic facet of the meaning of the verb and does not refer specifically to any
% participants in an event denoted by the verb; it serves to characterize the nature of the action rather than to refer
% to any of its participants. >>

% present in the syntax

% *Naess (2007: 130-134)*  
% > “In English... condi-
% tions for the omission of non-subject complements are limited to particular lexi-
% cally defined environments. The most commonly discussed of these is the object
% slot for such verbs as EAT, READ, SING, COOK, SEW and BAKE... which are un-
% derstood as having, when used intransitively, an understood object roughly repre-
% sented as the word STUFF” (Fillmore 1986 :95). Fillmore assumes that the ability to
% occur with what he calls Indefinite Null Complements (that is, “deleted” objects) is
% specified in the lexicon for each verb: “From the reality that omissibility phenom-
% ena of the sort discussed in this paper are tighly connected with specific senses of
% specific words, it seems unavoidable that (at least in these cases) closely related
% word senses must be listed separately in lexical entries” (Fillmore 1986 :106).
% Rice (1988) suggests that IOD is not a possibility specified in the lexical entry
% of a particular lexeme, but rather a function of the different ways in which the
% events denoted by certain verbs can be construed: “[C]ertain construals of transi-
% tive events are such that they focus on the active participant and leave the acted-
% upon participant unspecified and, most importantly, to be filled in by a default
% value” (Rice 1988 :203). She argues that objects can be omitted when there is a
% default interpretation for a missing object, exemplifying this with ‘John ate a meal’
% as the default interpretation for John ate. The verbs allowing such omission must
% be “semantically neutral”, not conflating action and manner (contrast John ate with
% *John nibbled), and the omitted object shows a “low degree of semantic independ-
% ence from the verb” (Rice 1988 :204).

% In Mittwoch (1971) and (1982) I pointed out that the deleted element could not

% TUTTE COSE FONDAMENTALI DA SPOSTARE NEI PARAGRAFI GIUSTI!  
% >  For Rice (1988), INO represent variation

% warrant additional lexical entries”. In her view, this forces researchers like Bresnan (1982)
% or Hale and Keyser (1986) to make unwarranted assumptions about the lexicon’s power.
% Rice sees object omission as a result of a collection of paradigmatic rather than idiosyncratic
% semantic factors, such as the verb type (verbs that conflate action and manner tend to resist
% object omission: *Celia nibbled/chewed/bit versus Celia ate), or the object type (objects
% denoting wholes are more likely to be left out than objects denoting parts: Travis let Billy
% drive (the car) versus Travis let Billy gun *(the motor)). In general, Rice claims, the se-
% mantically ‘neutral’ verbs with objects that are neither too specific nor too general are the
% most prone to object omission. The omitted object then represents the verb’s ‘prototypical
% complement’, giving rise to the default interpretation, cf. When he goes to Boston, John
% drives (a car / *a Toyota / *a motorcycle / *a vehicle).

% *Ahringberg (2015: 7)*  
% > 2.3.1 Lexical licensing
% According to Fillmore (1986, p. 98) the lexical properties of the predicate are essential in the
% licensing of null instantiation, which implies, in in broad terms, that some transitive predicates
% can allow their objects to be left out whereas other cannot. This is generally conceived as the
% fundamental factor also in other studies on the subject (e.g. Goldberg, 1995; Lambrecht &
% Lemoine, 2005; Prytz, 2009; Bäckström, 2013). Fillmore (1986, p. 98) further claims that this
% kind of lexical description is more consistent than a semantic one, as some verbs allow null
% instantiation whereas predicates with synonymous meanings may require their complements to
% be expressed. For example, the verbs protest and find out can be used without objects, whereas
% oppose and discover cannot, even though the verbs are “semantically related” (Fillmore, 1986,
% p. 98).

% *Ahringberg (2015: 8)*  
% > A single predicate may denote several senses and
% Fillmore (1986, p. 99) emphasises that with polysemous transitive verbs, in other words verbs
% with several different senses, it is rather certain types of the senses and not the predicates per
% se that permit leaving out the object. Likewise, it appears that only particular kinds of
% complements allow being omitted in some cases. For example, a left out object of the verb lose
% (Fillmore, 1986, p. 100) can only refer to a certain kind of competition or election, but not to
% an item which one has forgotten or mislaid. It therefore appears that null instantiation cannot
% be fully accounted for from lexical factors only. 

% *Newman & Rice (2006: 4)*  
% > Huddleston and Pullum (2002: 303-305) refine Huddleston [1988]’s notion of
% intransitivity by offering a sub-categorization of types of ‘unexpressed
% objects’ of intransitive verbs. EAT and DRINK participate in two such
% patterns of omissibility: ‘specific category indefinites’ and ‘normal
% category indefinites’. The former refers to the possibility of understanding
% the intransitive uses of EAT and DRINK specifically as ‘eat a meal’ and
% ‘drink alcoholic drink’ respectively; the latter refers to the use of
% intransitive EAT and DRINK when the unexpressed object is interpreted as
% the ‘indefinite, typical, unexceptional’ exemplar (‘food’ in the case of EAT,
% ‘water’ or ‘beverage’ presumably, in the case of DRINK).  
% The traditional view of an intransitive vs. (mono)transitive distinction,
% as enunciated in Huddleston (1988) and Huddleston and Pullum (2002), is
% by no means compelling. One could just as well argue that the intransitive
% use in (3a) really involves one participant (the agent phrase) and describes
% an activity of that participant, similar to the way in which the intransitive
% verb run in English describes an activity of a runner. Other associated
% entities can be a necessary part of a larger semantic frame of intransitive
% verbs (legs in the case of run, food in the case of eat), but this does not
% require us to say that they are second participants which are simply
% unexpressed. [...]  
% A more provocative view of transitivity can be found in Van Valin and
% LaPolla (1997: 115). They speak of the English predicate as having either
% one or two arguments in its logical structure, similar to Huddleston’s
% distinction between intransitive and monotransitive uses of EAT. Their
% representation of the logical form of EAT expresses the alternatives through
% the parenthesized (y) embedded in the argument structure.

% Further evidence for a weak indefinite reading of understood objects comes from the

% QUESTA PAGINA DICE IN MODO SINTETICO COSE MOLTO IMPORTANTI!!!  
% > 3.1.1. Indefinite Null Objects
% This category, also known as Indefinite Null Complements (henceforth INCs) [Fillmore
% 1986] or Unspecified Object Alternation [Browne 1971], is typical of a variety of activity
% verbs of the eat type, such as drink, sing, bake, cook and paint among the others, which have
% a pronounced manner component in their meaning and fairly circumscribed selectional
% restrictions. Hence, the content of the null object is more or less predictable: it will
% correspond to the literal rather than to the metaphorical meaning of the verb , and is
% sometimes argued to be restricted in usage, i.e. an expression such as I’m cleaning IS most
% likely to refer to the interior of a house, rather than to one’s teeth. [...]  
% However, postulating a reading of these verbs in terms of stereotypic entities associated to
% them does not always seem appropriate, since while in example (3) the phantom object is a
% meal, i.e. the apparently stereotypic entity associated to the verb eat, in an example like the
% most likely context would not lead to the interpretation that the person is accustomed to
% having a meal or as many meals as she can during the whole day.
% (5) I started working out, but I would eat all day after that.
% On the contrary, the most typical interpretation in this case is likely to be achieved through
% the underspecified word “food”, a representative of the entire class of edible things. However,
% the fact that the object is unexpressed in this case suggests that what the person eats is
% irrelevant for the current purpose of the interaction.
% We can suppose, in this respect, that a better explanation of the restrictions on these null
% objects is that they have to be consistent with the underlying context, the intentional structure
% of discourse and the shared relevance [Sperber and Wilson 1986] at the time of utterance.

% must project a single argument, whereas verbs expressing complex eventualities alway occur
% with at least two obligatory elements in the syntax. The former class is represented by activity
% type verbs. For instance, run lexicalizes a single event in its lexical representation, which in
% turn yields the obligatory appearance of a single argument (i.e. an agent) in subject position.
% A prototypical verb exemplifying the latter class is the causative verb, break, which is

% Thus an influential paper by Grimshaw (1993) draws a distinction between
% structural and content components of meaning. The objects of change-of-state
% verbs are structural, and must be projected; the objects of activity verbs are
% content arguments, and are in principle optional (subject to certain ill-
% understood restrictions). The reason is that change-of-state verbs have a
% complex event structure involving something like x cause y to change state,
% where y represents the object, whereas activity verbs have a simple structure: x
% act. Additional components of meaning that distinguish between different verbs
% in each structure are content components in this theory.

% 1995, a.o.). Martı́ argues that the INO of verbs like eat, bake, smoke, drink, read, write,
% hunt, cook, sing, carve, knit, weed, file, write, etc. are grammatically represented, number-
% neutral nouns, not too different from nouns incorporating into verbs in noun-incorporating
% languages. Her argumentation is based on the fact that English verbs with implicit indefi-
% nite objects are generally atelic (except for John ate for/in and hour ), and they describe
% conventional, name-worthy, institutionalized, habitual activities – just like verbs that have
% undergone noun-incorporation (cf. Mithun 1984, Dayal 2011b:164). I get back to the ties

% NOUN INCORPORATION! TORNA SPESSO, MERITA UN PARAGRAFO A PARTE?  
% > That there is a notional, even if unuttered, object (indicated in parentheses) in
% the interpretations of the object-less versions of these sentences is uncontrover-
% sial. The controversial question is whether there is an object at any point in the
% grammatical derivation of the object-less sentences, despite its lack of phonological
% realization.
% Carston (2004), Groefsema (1995), Hall (2009), Iten et al. (2004), Recanati
% (2002) and Wilson and Sperber (2000) have suggested that, in at least some of
% the uses of these seemingly object-less sentences, there is indeed no object at any
% level of linguistic representation. Instead, that object is provided for pragmatically.
% In these cases, given appropriate pragmatic pressures, language users enrich gram-
% matical interpretations in such a way as to provide the missing material. Here I
% argue that an object is, on the contrary, part of the linguistic representation of
% sentences such as (37)–(41) in all of their uses. This object, however, is not a
% run-of-the-mill syntactic object, but an object whose properties are those of nouns
% in noun incorporation constructions found in languages such as West Greenlandic,
% Frisian, and many others. The argument rests on the following logic: if these
% notional objects behave like linguistic category X (i.e. incorporated nouns), then
% the null hypothesis is that the notional objects are themselves instantiations of that
% linguistic category X. The only difference between the objects of interest here and
% those that appear in noun incorporation is that the former, but not the latter, are
% phonologically null.14

% *Martì (2015: 454)*

% When the noun and the verb are put together, a number of associated effects follow.
% Importantly, the object noun loses its status as a regular syntactic object. This can
% be seen in the fact that the nouns in these constructions must always appear bare

% *Martì (2015: 455)*  
% ALTRE IMPORTANTI CONSIDERAZIONI SULLA NOUN INCORPORATION  
% > In West Greenlandic, an erga-
% tive language, objects of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive (unergative) verbs
% are marked with ABSOLUTIVE Case, and subjects of transitive verbs are marked with
% ERGATIVE Case. In (42)b, where the noun has incorporated, the subject is marked
% with ABSOLUTIVE, not ERGATIVE, Case.
% Word order is also affected, so that incorporated nouns always precede the
% verb, independently of the canonical position of regular syntactic objects in the
% language in question. [...]  
% There are a number of semantic characteristics that are associated with
% noun incorporation. The incorporated noun is interpreted indefinitely and
% non-specifically: compare the a and b examples in (42)–(44). The indefinite,
% non-specific semantics of the nouns that participate in noun incorporation is a
% widely noted fact in the literature (see Carlson, 2006; van Geenhoven, 1998; Gerdts
% and Marlett, 2008; Mardirussian, 1975, p. 386; Mithun, 1984; de Reuse, 1994;
% Spencer, 1991; Sullivan, 1984, among others). A second cross-linguistically stable
% semantic property of incorporated nouns is that they typically take narrow scope
% with respect to other operators in the sentence 

% *Martì (2015: 456)*  
% > Verbs that are incorporated into typically designate name-worthy, typical activi-
% ties. For example, Axelrod (1990, p. 193) says that ‘ ... incorporation provides the
% lexicalized expression of a typical activity’. And Mithun (1984, p. 848) says that
% ‘some entity, quality or activity is recognized sufficiently often to be considered
% name-worthy in its own right’.

% *Martì (2015: 457)*  
% > It is well known that implicit indefinite objects are interpreted as non-specific
% indefinites with plain existential import (Bresnan, 1978; Dowty, 1981; Fillmore,

% that are conventionally eaten. Whereas it is perfectly possible to say that John is eat-

% In fact, this is precisely the argument made by Dyk (1997) regarding the nature

% the verbs that take implicit indefinite indefinite objects, such as English eat. [...]  
% This means that unergatives, detransitivized and incorporated-into verbs form a

% incorporated into in Frisian and these very same restrictions are strikingly observed
% for detransitivized verbs. For example, only verbs that select for a Patient object
% allow incorporation. The verbs corresponding to English notice, hate and know don’t

% Chung and Ladusaw (2004) propose that there is a mode of composition called

% *Newman & Rice (2006: 14)*

% > These possibilities cannot be attributed solely to lexical properties of the verb; if this
% were the case, certain verbs would always be able to appear without their objects
% regardless of the construction or discourse context, and others would never be able to
% appear without an object. As we will show, this is not the case. Rather, following Roberge
% (2003), we propose that null or implicit objects can be attributed to a Transitivity
% Requirement (TR) just as null subjects are ultimately due to the EPP. Recoverability for
% the EPP is morphologically based, as is evident in null subject languages, while
% recoverability involving the TR may also be semantically and pragmatically based; as we
% will show below, such recovery may be based on information derived from the verb's
% lexical semantics and Generalised Conversational Implicatures (formalised as in Levinson
% 2000) involved in the interpretation of reduced nominal forms. The factors that contribute
% to licensing superficial intransitivity—the absence of an overt object—may include lexical
% semantics, functional elements, discourse factors, and trans-clausal structural elements.
% This view is supported by a comparative study of null object possibilities in French and
% English. [...]  
% The concept of transitivity has been interpreted as a continuum in certain works, and a
% distinction has been proposed between syntactic transitivity and semantic transitivity; see,
% among many others, Blinkenberg (1960), Desclés (1998), Hopper et Thompson (1980),
% Lazard (1994). Surprisingly little is ever said about the object position itself. The
% hypothesis in Roberge (2003) is that there exists a Transitivity Requirement (TR),
% whereby an object position is always included in VP, independently of the lexical choice
% of V. The empirical motivation of this hypothesis is the well documented evidence (see in
% particular Blinkenberg (1960), Larjavaara (2000)) that any “transitive” verb has the
% potential to appear without a direct object and any “unergative” verb has the potential to
% appear with a direct object. To account for these facts, there must be a mechanism to
% generate the direct-object position, either optionally or obligatorily. The TR represents the
% second, more restrictive, possibility and conveys the concept of transitivity as a property
% of the predicate (the VP), rather than as a property of the lexical content of V. The TR is
% the internal-argument counterpart to the EPP.

% Two recent studies—Larjavaara (2000) on French and García Velasco & Portero
% Muñoz (2002) on English. [...]  
% The two agree that indefinite or generic null objects do not have a

% activity rather than an accomplishment reading of the verb; L notes that null objects can
% focus attention on the activity. Both point out that the lexical characteristics of the verb
% can help to identify the referent of the null object. [...]  
% In a third study, Goldberg (2001) investigates unexpressed objects of causative verbs
% (those that entail a change of state in the patient argument) in English. She concludes that
% the option of leaving these arguments unexpressed depends largely on factors relating to
% information structure: the unexpressed object is typically neither topical nor focal, and the

% another verb, or by having a narrow focus.

% proposes that both the arbitrary third-person human interpretation, meaning “people in
